"""
Synthesis module: bootstrap IDP configurations and synthetic, labeled test
sets from a prompt and/or example documents.

Pieces:
  * ``schema_bridge`` - convert IDP config-class schemas <-> the SEED document
    generator's ``schema.json`` format, preserving leaf field names exactly.
  * ``schema_author`` - author a document-class schema from a natural-language
    prompt (optionally adapting a catalog seed schema).
  * ``catalog`` - a unified index of reusable schema/sample assets across the
    generator's built-ins and IDP's ``config_library``.
  * ``engine`` - runtime-agnostic adapter to the SEED generator. Imported
    lazily because it pulls heavy/optional native dependencies.

The ``engine`` submodule is intentionally NOT imported here so that schema
authoring, catalog lookup and the bridge work without the generator installed.
Import it explicitly: ``from idp_common.synthesis import engine``.
