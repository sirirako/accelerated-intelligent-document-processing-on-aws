"""
Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) as a pure OCR engine.

BDA "standard output" for documents is a managed OCR product: given a page it
returns reading-order markdown (with tables and layout), plus word-level
bounding boxes and confidence. This module adapts that output to the same
Amazon Textract response shape the OCR service already consumes, so the rest of
the pipeline (``_parse_textract_response``, ``_generate_text_confidence_data``,
``_build_page_data``) works unchanged.

Two things about BDA standard output drive the design here (both verified
against the live service):

- **Sync ``InvokeDataAutomation`` is capped at ~10 pages.** The OCR service
  therefore invokes BDA one page at a time (feeding each already-rendered page
  image), which also gives per-page concurrency and retry isolation. So the
  converter here operates on the single-page standard output.
- **BDA line-level confidence is unreliable** (observed ~0.01 for every line),
  while word-level confidence is sound. We reconstruct each line's confidence as
  the mean of its child words' confidence.

BDA confidences are 0-1; Textract confidences are 0-100, so we scale by 100.
BDA bounding boxes are normalized 0-1 ({left, top, width, height}), matching
Textract's convention.

**Coordinate frame: BDA rectifies the page.** BDA internally deskews /
perspective-corrects the input image and returns every bounding box normalized
against that *rectified* image, not against the original page image the pipeline
stored (``image.jpg``) and the UI displays. On a clean, axis-aligned scan the
two frames coincide and boxes line up. On a skewed/rotated scan they don't, and
overlays land in the wrong spot. Each page's ``asset_metadata.corners`` gives
where the rectified image's four corners fall in the *original* image (0-1,
ordered TL, TR, BR, BL), so we map every box back into original-image space via
bilinear interpolation before emitting geometry. This makes BDA geometry agree
with Textract's (which is never rectified). The mapping is a no-op when corners
are absent or identity, preserving behavior for clean pages / older payloads.
