"""v0.5 → v0.6 config-shape migration.

v0.6 reframes per-field confidence and geometry as OUTPUTS OF EXTRACTION rather
than a separate stage:

    extraction.assessment_integration       -> extraction.confidence.mode
    assessment.{model,prompts,image,...}     -> extraction.confidence.*
    assessment.inshard_list_batch_size       -> extraction.confidence.list_batch_size
    assessment.granular                      -> DROPPED (granular assessment retired)
    assessment.geometry_mode / legacy flag   -> extraction.geometry.mode  (renamed values)
    assessment.hitl_enabled                  -> hitl.enabled
    assessment.default_confidence_threshold  -> hitl.confidence_threshold

The top-level ``assessment`` block is slimmed to the standalone-step carrier
(``enabled`` + ``postHook``) so the ``postAssessment`` pipeline-hook point and the
step's own enable/bypass keep working until the step is retired.

The transform is a pure ``dict -> dict`` and is IDEMPOTENT: it short-circuits once
a config is stamped ``config_format_version == "0.6"``, so it is safe to apply on
every read (both on the raw custom delta before merge and again after merge inside
``IDPConfig`` validation).

    that sets ``agentic.enabled`` but omits ``mode`` is a footgun: after the delta is

    has ``mode='simple'`` + ``agentic.enabled=true`` and ``reconcile`` then SILENTLY
    flips ``agentic.enabled`` back to false — the author asked for advanced/agentic
