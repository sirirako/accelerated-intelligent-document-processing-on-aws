"""Shared large-list assessment batching + reconciliation.

A single assessment inference over a large list field (e.g. a 120-row
transaction table) is unreliable: the model under-enumerates or omits the list
entirely, leaving most rows unassessed. This module holds the two primitives
that make large-list assessment robust, factored out so BOTH the standalone
Assessment step (``AssessmentService.process_document_section``) and the agentic
in-shard path (``ExtractionService``) share exactly one implementation:

- :func:`reconcile_assessment_to_data` — force the per-field assessment to
  index-align with the extracted data (truncate over-long lists, pad short/omitted
  ones with per-sub-field placeholders, fan a per-row confidence out to per-column
  leaves) so ``explainability_info[0][field][i]`` lines up with
  ``inference_result[field][i]`` for every list cell.
- :func:`assess_results_batched` — slice the single largest oversized list field
  into ``list_batch_size`` chunks, assess each chunk with the SAME scalars/context,
  concatenate the per-row assessments in order, and reconcile against the full data.

The module is deliberately import-light (no strands / PIL / boto3 at top level)
so it is cheap to import from the assessment service and unit-testable without the
agentic stack. Metering is accumulated with ``utils.merge_metering_data`` — the
canonical token-count merge — so this module carries no dependency on the
extraction package.

# output is variable — the model occasionally over-generates on a heavy multimodal

    notable happened (a clean run produces no issues). Severity ladder (only the

    - ``schema_mismatch_fields`` set → ``assessment_schema_mismatch`` (**error**):
      extraction returned list-valued data for an attribute the class schema does
      not define as an array; the enhancer collapsed it so no model can score its
      rows. Takes precedence — the true fix is upstream (schema/extraction), not a
      stronger confidence model.
    - else ``unrecoverable_rows > 0`` → ``assessment_incomplete`` (**error**): rows
      are still unscored after the full self-healing ladder.
    - else ``deadline_reached`` → ``assessment_deadline_reached`` (**warning**):
      the wall-clock guard stopped escalation before coverage completed.
    - else rows were ACTUALLY recovered (retry or escalation counters > 0) →
      ``assessment_recovered_with_retries`` (**info**): self-healed, but
      token-inefficiently (worth flagging).
    - else a call truncated but NOTHING was recovered and nothing is missing
      (e.g. the model truncated on an empty/near-empty list because extraction
      produced few/no rows) → ``assessment_truncated`` (**warning**): report the
      truncation honestly WITHOUT claiming a recovery that never happened.

    IMPORTANT: this deliberately does NOT claim "recovered" merely because a call
    truncated. A truncation with 0 rows recovered and 0 unrecoverable is not a
    success — it usually means extraction under-produced rows (see the
    extraction-side ``extraction_incomplete`` issue) and the confidence pass hit
    its ceiling on whatever little was there.

    **Schema-mismatch takes precedence over all rungs.** When
    ``schema_mismatch_fields`` is set, the unscored rows are NOT a model/truncation
    problem — extraction produced list-valued data for an attribute the class
    schema does not define as an array, so the confidence enhancer collapsed it and
    no model can score it per-row. That is emitted as ``assessment_schema_mismatch``
    (**error**) naming the offending field(s) and the true fix (correct the
    extraction schema / prompt), instead of a misleading "escalation failed" story.

    the model's cap (common with ``geometry.mode: llm``, which adds a bounding box
    per cell). Halving shrinks the output until it fits. Records activity in
    ``stats`` for downstream visibility. Sequential (no fan-out), consistent with
    the batcher's cost model.

    **Wall-clock guard (1.5):** ``deadline_epoch`` (absolute epoch seconds) bounds
    the recursion — each halving step doubles the number of sequential model calls,
    so a small-cap model that keeps truncating (e.g. Nova Lite over an
    ``llm_grounded`` batch too large for its output cap) can otherwise fan a single
    batch into dozens of ~60s calls and run a shard/merge Lambda into its 900s
    wall. When the next call wouldn't fit before the deadline (minus safety
    reserve), the recursion stops, flags ``deadline_reached``, and keeps the
    truncated slice's best-effort scores rather than risk a hard task timeout.
    No-op when ``deadline_epoch`` is None (local / no context).

    Returns ``{"rows": [per-row assessment...], "scalars": {enhanced non-big
    fields}, "alerts": [...], "metering": {...}, "duration": float}`` where
    ``rows`` is index-aligned to the input ``rows``.

    """Assess one scope, batching large list fields across multiple inferences.

    A single assessment call over a large list (e.g. 120 transaction rows) is
    unreliable — the model under-enumerates or omits the list, leaving rows
    unassessed. When the largest list field exceeds ``batch_size``, the list is
    sliced into batches; each batch is assessed with the SAME scalars/context (so
    scalar assessments and the document context are preserved) but only that
    batch's rows, and the per-row assessments are concatenated in order.
    Scalar/group assessments come from the first batch.

    Concurrency (item 4): batches are INDEPENDENT and may run concurrently when
    ``max_concurrent_batches > 1``. To avoid the cacheWrite storm that made the
    original design sequential, the FIRST batch runs alone to warm the prompt
    cache (static instructions + per-doc image/OCR block), THEN the remaining
    batches fan out across a bounded thread pool and hit the warm cache. Row
    order is preserved (ordered chunks + ``pool.map``). ``max_concurrent_batches
    <= 1`` keeps the original fully-sequential behavior.

    ``assessment_service`` must expose the pure inference core
    ``assess_results(class_label, extraction_results, document_text, page_images,
    ocr_text_confidence) -> AssessmentCoreResult``.

    If a batch's response is TRUNCATED at the model's max-output-token ceiling
    (e.g. ``geometry.mode: llm`` makes per-row output too large for a small-cap
    model like Nova Lite), that slice is recursively halved and re-assessed until
    it fits — instead of accepting default 0.5 / null-placeholder scores. This
    activity is recorded and returned under ``split_stats`` for visibility.

    **Self-healing (this module's robustness spine):**
    - **Token-aware first-pass sizing (1.1):** when ``confidence_model_id`` is
      given, the effective batch size is shrunk (never grown) to fit the model's
      output cap via :func:`compute_token_aware_batch_size`, so the FIRST pass
      already fits instead of relying on the adaptive splitter to bisect from 25.
    - **Model-escalation ladder (1.2):** when ``escalation_enabled`` and an
      ``escalation_model`` is available, rows still unscored after token-aware
      shrink + same-model retries are re-assessed on the stronger model (bigger
      output cap) — the step that actually fixes small-cap truncation. Bounded by
      ``max_escalation_rounds``. **Guarded against schema mismatch:** when
      ``class_schema`` is supplied and a "missing"-row list field is not declared
      ``type: array`` in it (an off-schema/hallucinated attribute or a
      scalar-typed one that extraction returned as a list), the enhancer collapses
      it to a single default leaf that no model can turn into per-row scores — so
      both retry and escalation are SKIPPED for that field (recorded in
      ``schema_mismatch_fields``) instead of wasting a large-model call.

    Returns ``{"assessment", "alerts", "metering", "parsing_succeeded",
    "duration_seconds", "split_stats"}``. Falls back to a single call (still
    reconciled) when no list field exceeds the batch size.

    back by index so large-list confidence coverage reaches 100% (not just null
    placeholders).

    **Schema-mismatch guard:** ``big_field`` may look permanently unscored not
    because the model dropped rows but because the extracted data is a list while
    the class schema does not declare the field as ``type: array`` (an off-schema
    attribute, or one typed as a scalar). The confidence enhancer collapses such a
    field to a single default leaf, so its rows are padded to null placeholders
    that never recover — no model can fix a schema mismatch. When ``class_schema``
    is supplied and flags this, BOTH recovery rungs are skipped for the field, the
    reason is recorded in ``split_stats['schema_mismatch_fields']``, and the rows
    are left as-is (surfaced by the caller as a schema-mismatch issue, not a futile
    escalation).

    The self-healing ladder, cheapest-first:
    1. **Same-model retry** — up to ``max_retries`` rounds on ``one_call`` (each
       chunk through the adaptive splitter, so a truncating chunk is halved). A
       round that recovers nothing stops this rung early.
    2. **Model escalation** — if rows are STILL missing and ``escalation_one_call``
       + ``escalation_model`` are set, re-assess only the residual rows on the
       stronger model (bigger output cap — the step that actually fixes small-cap
       truncation). Bounded by ``max_escalation_rounds``; a round that recovers
       nothing stops.

    **Wall-clock guard (1.5):** ``deadline_epoch`` (absolute epoch seconds, from
    the Lambda ``context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()``) bounds the slow
    escalation rung — before each escalation round the ladder checks the round's
    estimated cost fits in remaining time minus a safety reserve; if not it stops,
    sets ``deadline_reached`` in stats, and keeps what was recovered rather than
    risk a hard Lambda timeout. No-op when ``deadline_epoch`` is None.

    Sequential (no fan-out); best-effort (a failed call keeps the placeholder).
