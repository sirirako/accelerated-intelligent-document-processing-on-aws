"""Runtime-agnostic primitives + pluggable orchestration for sharded extraction.

This module is the **single source of truth** for how a section's extraction is
sharded, persisted, and merged. Two thin schedulers drive the same primitives:

- :class:`InProcessRuntime` (default) — plans shards, runs them concurrently via
  ``asyncio.gather`` + a semaphore, then merges. Identical observable behaviour
  to the historical ``concurrent_structured_output_async``. This is what a
  notebook / CLI / single Lambda uses; sharding works fully here with **no Step
  Functions dependency**.
- :class:`StepFunctionsRuntime` (production) — a thin marker selected by the
  infra/Lambda layer. The Step Functions Distributed Map calls
  :func:`extract_one_shard` once per iteration (one fresh Lambda per shard) and a
  following merge state calls :func:`merge_shard_results`. Because each shard
  persists its own result idempotently to S3, SFN's native per-iteration retry
  re-runs only the failed/incomplete shards — completed shards load from S3.

The primitives are deliberately import-light at module top (no strands / PIL /
boto3) so the planning, persistence-idempotency and runtime-selection logic is
cheap to import and unit-testable without the agentic stack. The strands-backed
agent call is reached lazily inside :func:`_default_shard_runner`.
