"""
Token-budgeted page sharding for concurrent agentic extraction.

When ``extraction.agentic.max_concurrent_batches > 1`` the extraction service
splits a section's pages across several agents that run concurrently. The
original implementation handed every agent the *whole* document and merely told
it (in text) to "ignore the other pages" — so each agent still loaded the full
context and could overflow the model's context window (the failure mode that
prompted this module). This planner instead computes **page ranges sized to a
token budget**, so each shard's input actually fits.

Design (see PR discussion):
- **Size-bounded, not count-bounded.** Pages are grouped so each shard's
  estimated input tokens stay under ``token_budget``. ``max_concurrent_batches``
  is an *upper bound on parallelism*, not the number of shards: a very large
  section produces as many shards as needed to fit, run at most
  ``max_concurrent_batches`` at a time.
- **Page-aligned splits never cut a table row.** A table spans pages but each
  *row* lives on one page, so splitting between pages keeps rows intact; the
  merge re-concatenates list fields in order.
- **Opportunistic table-boundary preference (forward hook).** ``plan_shards``
  accepts ``table_boundary_pages`` and, when given, prefers to close a shard
  just before such a page (within budget — never grown past it). This parameter
  is implemented and tested but the service does not yet feed it real OCR
  boundaries (it passes ``None``); page-aligned splitting is already row-safe
  on its own, so this is a refinement to wire up later, not a correctness need.

This module is pure (no PIL/Strands/boto3) so it is cheap to import and unit-test.

        max_shards: Optional hard cap on the number of shards. When the budget

            shards on page count. ``None`` or ``<= 0`` disables the page ceiling

        table_boundary_pages: 0-based indices of pages that *start* a new table
