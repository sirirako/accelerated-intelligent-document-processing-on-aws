# IDP Extraction Module

This module provides functionality for extracting structured information from document sections using LLMs with support for few-shot example prompting to improve accuracy.

## Overview

The extraction module is designed to process document sections, extract key information based on configured attributes, and return structured results. It supports multimodal extraction using both text and images, and can leverage concrete examples to improve extraction accuracy and consistency.

## Components

- **ExtractionService**: Main service class for performing extractions with few-shot example support
- **Models**: Data classes for extraction results

## Usage

The ExtractionService uses a Document-based approach which simplifies integration with the entire IDP pipeline:

```python
from idp_common import get_config
from idp_common.extraction.service import ExtractionService
from idp_common.models import Document

# Initialize the service with configuration
config = get_config()
extraction_service = ExtractionService(config=config)

# Load your document
document = Document(...)  # Document with sections already classified

# Process a specific section in the document
updated_document = extraction_service.process_document_section(
    document=document,
    section_id="section-123"
)

# Access the extraction results URI from the section
section = next(s for s in updated_document.sections if s.section_id == "section-123")
result_uri = section.extraction_result_uri
print(f"Extraction results stored at: {result_uri}")

# To get the attributes, you would load them from the result URI
# For example:
# extracted_fields = s3.get_json_content(result_uri)
```

### Lambda Function Pattern

For AWS Lambda functions, we recommend using a focused document with only the relevant section:

```python
# Get document and section from event
full_document = Document.from_dict(event.get("document", {}))
section_id = event.get("section", {}).get("section_id", "")

# Find the section - should be present
section = next((s for s in full_document.sections if s.section_id == section_id), None)
if not section:
    raise ValueError(f"Section {section_id} not found in document")

# Filter document to only include this section and its pages
section_document = full_document
section_document.sections = [section]

# Keep only pages needed for this section
needed_pages = {}
for page_id in section.page_ids:
    if page_id in full_document.pages:
        needed_pages[page_id] = full_document.pages[page_id]
section_document.pages = needed_pages

# Process the focused document
extraction_service = ExtractionService(config=CONFIG)
processed_document = extraction_service.process_document_section(
    document=section_document,
    section_id=section_id
)
```

## Configuration

The extraction service uses the following configuration structure:

```json
{
  "extraction": {
    "model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "top_k": 5,
    "system_prompt": "You are an expert at extracting information from documents...",
    "task_prompt": "Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document: {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}\n\n{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}\n\nDocument text:\n{DOCUMENT_TEXT}"
  },
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "invoice",
      "description": "An invoice document",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "invoice_number",
          "description": "The invoice number or ID"
        },
        {
          "name": "date",
          "description": "The invoice date"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Few Shot Example Feature

The extraction service supports few-shot learning through example-based prompting. This feature allows you to provide concrete examples of documents with their expected attribute extractions, significantly improving model accuracy, consistency, and reducing hallucination.

### Overview

Few-shot examples work by including reference documents with known expected attribute values in the prompts sent to the AI model. Unlike classification which uses examples from all document classes, extraction uses examples only from the specific class being processed to provide targeted guidance for attribute extraction.

### Key Differences from Classification

- **Example Scope**: Extraction uses examples ONLY from the specific document class being processed (e.g., only "letter" examples when extracting from a "letter" document)
- **Prompt Field**: Uses `attributesPrompt` instead of `classPrompt` from examples
- **Purpose**: Shows expected attribute extraction format and values rather than distinguishing between document types

### Configuration

Few-shot examples are configured in the document class definitions within your configuration file:

```yaml
classes:
  - name: letter
    description: "A formal written correspondence..."
    attributes:
      - name: sender_name
        description: "The name of the person who wrote the letter..."
      - name: sender_address
        description: "The physical address of the sender..."
      - name: recipient_name
        description: "The name of the person receiving the letter..."
      # ... other attributes
    examples:
      - classPrompt: "This is an example of the class 'letter'"
        name: "Letter1"
        attributesPrompt: |
          expected attributes are:
              "sender_name": "Will E. Clark",
              "sender_address": "206 Maple Street P.O. Box 1056 Murray Kentucky 42071-1056",
              "recipient_name": "The Honorable Wendell H. Ford",
              "recipient_address": "United States Senate Washington, D. C. 20510",
              "date": "10/31/1995",
              "subject": null,
              "letter_type": "opposition letter",
              "signature": "Will E. Clark",
              "cc": null,
              "reference_number": "TNJB 0008497"
        imagePath: "config_library/unified/few_shot_example/example-images/letter1.jpg"
      - classPrompt: "This is an example of the class 'letter'"
        name: "Letter2"
        attributesPrompt: |
          expected attributes are:
              "sender_name": "William H. W. Anderson",
              "sender_address": "P O. BOX 12046 CAMERON VILLAGE STATION RALEIGH N. c 27605",
              "recipient_name": "Mr. Addison Y. Yeaman",
              "recipient_address": "1600 West Hill Street Louisville, Kentucky 40201",
              "date": "10/14/1970",
              "subject": "Invitation to the Twelfth Annual Meeting of the TGIC",
              "letter_type": "Invitation",
              "signature": "Bill",
              "cc": null,
              "reference_number": null
        imagePath: "config_library/unified/few_shot_example/example-images/letter2.png"
```

### Configuration Parameters

Each few-shot example includes:

- **classPrompt**: A description identifying this as an example of the document class (used for classification)
- **attributesPrompt**: The expected attribute extraction results showing the exact JSON format and values expected
- **name**: A unique identifier for the example (for reference and debugging)
- **imagePath**: Path to example document image(s) - supports single files, local directories, or S3 prefixes

#### Image Path Options

The `imagePath` field now supports multiple formats for maximum flexibility:

**Single Image File (Original functionality)**:

```yaml
imagePath: "config_library/unified/few_shot_example/example-images/letter1.jpg"
```

**Local Directory with Multiple Images (New)**:

```yaml
imagePath: "config_library/unified/few_shot_example/example-images/"
```

**S3 Prefix with Multiple Images (New)**:

```yaml
imagePath: "s3://my-config-bucket/few-shot-examples/letter/"
```

**Direct S3 Image URI**:

```yaml
imagePath: "s3://my-config-bucket/few-shot-examples/letter/example1.jpg"
```

When pointing to a directory or S3 prefix, the system automatically:

- Discovers all image files with supported extensions (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.webp`)
- Sorts them alphabetically by filename for consistent ordering
- Includes each image as a separate content item in the few-shot examples
- Gracefully handles individual image loading failures without breaking the entire process

#### Environment Variables for Path Resolution

The system uses these environment variables for resolving relative paths:

- **`CONFIGURATION_BUCKET`**: S3 bucket name for configuration files
  - Used when `imagePath` doesn't start with `s3://`
  - The path is treated as a key within this bucket

- **`ROOT_DIR`**: Root directory for local file resolution
  - Used when `CONFIGURATION_BUCKET` is not set
  - The path is treated as relative to this directory

### Task Prompt Integration

To use few-shot examples, your task prompt must include the `{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}` placeholder:

```yaml
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    <background>
    You are an expert in business document analysis and information extraction.

    <task>
    Your task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a
    well-organized table format using JSON. Identify the main entities,
    attributes, or categories mentioned in the attributes list below and use
    them as keys in the JSON object.

    Here are the attributes you should extract:
    <attributes>
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    </attributes>

    <few_shot_examples>
    {FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}
    </few_shot_examples>

    </task>
    </background>

    The document type is {DOCUMENT_CLASS}. Here is the document content:
    <document_ocr_data>
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    </document_ocr_data>
```

### Benefits

Using few-shot examples provides several advantages for extraction:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Models understand the expected extraction format and attribute relationships better
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Examples establish exact JSON structure and value formats expected
3. **Reduced Hallucination**: Examples reduce the likelihood of made-up attribute values
4. **Better Null Handling**: Examples show when attributes should be null vs. empty strings
5. **Domain-Specific Understanding**: Examples help models understand domain-specific terminology and formats

### Best Practices

When creating few-shot examples for extraction:

#### 1. Show Complete Attribute Sets

```yaml
# Good example - shows all attributes with realistic values
attributesPrompt: |
  expected attributes are:
      "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
      "invoice_date": "01/15/2024",
      "vendor_name": "ACME Corp",
      "customer_name": "Tech Solutions Inc",
      "total_amount": "$1,250.00",
      "due_date": "02/15/2024",
      "po_number": "PO-789456"

# Avoid incomplete examples
attributesPrompt: |
  expected attributes are:
      "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001"
      # Missing other important attributes
```

#### 2. Handle Null Values Explicitly

```yaml
attributesPrompt: |
  expected attributes are:
      "sender_name": "John Smith",
      "cc": null,  # Explicitly show when fields are not present
      "reference_number": null,
      "subject": "Meeting Request",
      "attachments": null
```

#### 3. Use Realistic and Diverse Examples

- Include examples with different formatting styles
- Show both common cases and edge cases
- Use realistic data that represents your actual documents
- Include examples with varying levels of completeness

#### 4. Maintain Consistent Format

```yaml
# Consistent JSON format across all examples
attributesPrompt: |
  expected attributes are:
      "field1": "value1",
      "field2": "value2",
      "field3": null

# Avoid inconsistent formatting
attributesPrompt: |
  field1: value1
  field2 = "value2"
  field3: (empty)
```

#### 5. Organize Multiple Images

When using directories or S3 prefixes with multiple images:

```yaml
# Good: Use descriptive, ordered filenames
imagePath: "examples/letters/"
# Contents: 001_formal_letter.jpg, 002_informal_letter.png, 003_business_letter.jpg

# Good: Group related examples together
imagePath: "s3://config-bucket/examples/invoices/"
# Contents: invoice_simple.jpg, invoice_complex.png, invoice_international.jpg
```

### Class-Specific Example Filtering

The extraction service automatically filters examples by document class:

```python
# When processing a "letter" document, only letter examples are used
# When processing an "invoice" document, only invoice examples are used

# This ensures extraction examples are relevant and targeted
document = extraction_service.process_document_section(
    document=letter_document,  # Classified as "letter"
    section_id="section-1"
)
# Only letter examples will be included in the prompt
```

### Usage with Extraction Service

The few-shot examples are automatically integrated when using the extraction service:

```python
from idp_common import get_config
from idp_common.extraction.service import ExtractionService
from idp_common.models import Document

# Load configuration with few-shot examples
config = get_config()

# Initialize service - few-shot examples are automatically used
service = ExtractionService(
    region="us-east-1",
    config=config
)

# Examples are automatically included in prompts during extraction
# Only examples matching the document's classification are used
document = service.process_document_section(document, section_id)
```

The service automatically:

1. Loads few-shot examples from the configuration
2. Filters examples to only include those from the document's classified type
3. Includes them in extraction prompts using the `{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}` placeholder
4. Formats examples with both text and images for multimodal understanding

### Example Configuration Structure

Here's a complete example showing how few-shot examples integrate with document class definitions:

```yaml
classes:
  - name: email
    description: "A digital message with email headers..."
    attributes:
      - name: from_address
        description: "The email address of the sender..."
      - name: to_address
        description: "The email address of the primary recipient..."
      - name: subject
        description: "The topic of the email..."
      - name: date_sent
        description: "The date and time when the email was sent..."
    examples:
      - classPrompt: "This is an example of the class 'email'"
        name: "Email1"
        attributesPrompt: |
          expected attributes are: 
             "from_address": "Kelahan, Ben",
             "to_address": "TI New York: 'TI Minnesota",
             "cc_address": "Ashley Bratich (MSMAIL)",
             "bcc_address": null,
             "subject": "FW: Morning Team Notes 4/20",
             "date_sent": "04/18/1998",
             "attachments": null,
             "priority": null,
             "thread_id": null,
             "message_id": null
        imagePath: "config_library/unified/few_shot_example/example-images/email1.jpg"

extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    <background>
    You are an expert in business document analysis and information extraction.

    <task>
    Your task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a
    well-organized table format using JSON.

    Here are the attributes you should extract:
    <attributes>
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    </attributes>

    <few_shot_examples>
    {FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}
    </few_shot_examples>

    </task>
    </background>

    The document type is {DOCUMENT_CLASS}. Here is the document content:
    <document_ocr_data>
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    </document_ocr_data>
```

### Testing Few-Shot Examples

Use the provided test notebook to validate the few-shot functionality:

```python
# Test few-shot extraction examples
import sys
sys.path.append('../lib/idp_common_pkg')

from idp_common.extraction.service import ExtractionService
import yaml

# Load configuration with examples
with open('config_library/unified/few_shot_example/config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize service
service = ExtractionService(config=config)

# Test building examples for specific class
examples = service._build_few_shot_examples_content('letter')
print(f"Found {len(examples)} example items for 'letter' class")

# Test complete content building
content = service._build_content_with_few_shot_examples(
    task_prompt_template=config['extraction']['task_prompt'],
    document_text="Sample letter text...",
    class_label="letter",
    attribute_descriptions="sender_name\t[The person who wrote the letter]"
)
print(f"Built content with {len(content)} items")
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **No Examples Loaded**:
   - Verify `{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}` placeholder exists in task_prompt
   - Check that examples are defined for the document class being processed
   - Ensure example image paths are correct

2. **Images Not Found**:
   - Set `ROOT_DIR` environment variable for local development
   - Set `CONFIGURATION_BUCKET` for S3 deployment
   - Verify image files exist at specified paths

3. **Inconsistent Extraction Results**:
   - Review example quality and ensure they're representative
   - Check that `attributesPrompt` format matches expected output
   - Ensure examples cover the range of variations in your documents

4. **Poor Performance**:
   - Add more diverse examples for the document class
   - Improve example quality and accuracy
   - Ensure examples demonstrate proper null handling

## Error Handling

The ExtractionService has built-in error handling:

1. If a section ID is not found in the document, an exception is raised
2. If extraction fails for any reason, the error is captured in `document.errors`
3. All errors are logged for debugging
4. Few-shot example loading errors are handled gracefully with fallback to standard prompts

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, especially in serverless environments:

1. Only include the section being processed and its required pages
2. Set clear expectations about document structure and fail fast on violations
3. Use the Document model to track metering data
4. Consider the trade-off between few-shot example accuracy improvements and increased token costs

### Extraction Results Storage

The extraction service stores extraction results in S3 and only includes the S3 URI in the document:

1. Extracted attributes are written to S3 as JSON files
2. Only the S3 URI (`extraction_result_uri`) is included in the document
3. This approach prevents the document from growing too large when extraction results contain many attributes
4. To access the actual attributes, load them from the S3 URI when needed

## Multimodal Extraction

The service supports both text and image inputs:

1. Text content is read from each page's `parsed_text_uri`
2. Images are retrieved from each page's `image_uri`
3. Both are combined in a multimodal prompt to the LLM
4. Few-shot examples include both text prompts and document images for better understanding

## Thread Safety

The extraction service is designed to be thread-safe, supporting concurrent processing of multiple sections in parallel workloads.

## Agentic Extraction with Table Parsing Tool

The extraction service supports an optional **agentic extraction mode** powered by the Strands agent framework with tool-based structured output. When enabled, the extraction agent gains intelligent tools including a deterministic table parser for robust tabular data extraction.

### Enabling Agentic Extraction

Configure agentic extraction in your configuration file:

```yaml
extraction:
  model: "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Anthropic Claude recommended for agentic
  agentic:
    enabled: true
    max_concurrent_batches: 1  # Parallel processing (2-10 for very large docs)
    table_parsing:
      enabled: true  # Enable deterministic table parser tool
      min_confidence_threshold: 95.0  # OCR confidence target (Textract only)
      min_parse_success_rate: 0.90  # Parse quality threshold
      use_confidence_data: true  # Cross-reference with OCR confidence
      max_empty_line_gap: 3  # Tolerate up to N empty lines in tables
      auto_merge_adjacent_tables: true  # Merge table fragments
    validation:                # see "Schema-Constraint Validation" below
      enabled: false
```

> **Every `agentic.*` sub-option only takes effect when `agentic.enabled: true`**
> — `table_parsing`, `validation`, and `max_concurrent_batches` are all ignored
> for non-agentic extraction. In the **Configuration UI** these options are
> progressively disclosed: they appear only after you enable Agentic Extraction,
> the table-parsing thresholds appear only after you enable the parse_table tool,
> and the escalation model appears only when validation `fail_action` is
> `escalate` — so you only see the knobs that currently matter.

### Table Parsing Tool

When `table_parsing.enabled: true`, the extraction agent gains a `parse_table` tool that:

1. **Deterministically parses Markdown tables** from OCR text without LLM inference
2. **Handles OCR artifacts robustly**:
   - Tolerates empty lines (page breaks) within tables via configurable lookahead
   - Recovers from missing pipe characters in corrupted rows
   - Automatically merges table fragments with identical columns
3. **Provides quality metrics and warnings**:
   - `parse_success_rate`: Ratio of cleanly parsed rows
   - `avg_confidence`: OCR confidence scores (when available from Textract)
   - `low_confidence_cells`: Specific cells needing LLM verification
   - **⚠️ Warnings**: Alert agent to table fragmentation or quality issues
   - **ℹ️ Info**: Confirm successful gap recovery
4. **Enables hybrid extraction workflow**:
   - Agent uses `parse_table` for well-structured tabular data
   - Falls back to LLM extraction for complex layouts or poor quality
   - Cross-validates low-confidence cells using multimodal reasoning

### How It Works

```
1. Agent analyzes document and identifies Markdown tables
2. Agent calls parse_table(table_text, expected_columns)
3. Tool returns:
   - Structured rows as list of dicts
   - Quality metrics (parse_success_rate, avg_confidence)
   - Warnings about potential incompleteness
4. Agent reviews quality:
   - If good (parse_rate >= 0.90, confidence >= 95):
     * Calls map_table_to_schema with column mapping and transforms
     * Calls finalize_table_extraction with scalar fields
   - If poor or warnings present:
     * Falls back to LLM extraction for affected sections
     * Verifies low-confidence cells using document images
5. Agent validates completeness:
   - Cross-checks row counts against document visuals
   - Extracts from ALL table fragments if multiple found
   - Verifies schema constraints (e.g., min_length) are met
```

### Three-Tool Table Extraction Workflow

The table extraction uses a three-tool pipeline that keeps large data out of the LLM context, minimizing token usage:

```
parse_table ──► map_table_to_schema ──► finalize_table_extraction
   │                    │                        │
   ▼                    ▼                        ▼
 Agent State:       Agent State:             Agent State:
 last_parse_        mapped_table_            current_extraction
 table_result       rows                     (validated Pydantic)
```

**Step 1: `parse_table`** — Deterministic Markdown parser. Finds all tables, recovers from OCR artifacts, returns structured rows with quality metrics. Result stored in agent state as `last_parse_table_result`.

**Step 2: `map_table_to_schema`** — Bulk transformation of parsed rows using a column mapping. The agent provides a small mapping dict; the tool transforms all rows instantly. Supports:
- **`column_mapping`**: Maps table columns to schema fields (case-insensitive, fuzzy substring matching)
- **`static_fields`**: Constant values added to every row (e.g., `{"account_number": "1234"}`)
- **`value_transforms`**: Per-field transforms applied during mapping:
  - `strip_currency`: Removes `$` and `,` (e.g., `"$1,234.56"` → `"1234.56"`)
  - `strip_whitespace`: Removes all internal whitespace
  - `lowercase` / `uppercase`: Case conversion
- **Merged-row auto-splitting**: Detects OCR page-boundary artifacts where two rows are concatenated on one line (e.g., `"$57.90 $55.11"` in multiple columns) and splits them back into separate rows

Mapped rows accumulate in agent state as `mapped_table_rows` (supports multiple calls for chunked processing).

**Step 3: `finalize_table_extraction`** — Combines mapped table rows (from state) with scalar fields the agent provides. Validates the complete extraction against the Pydantic schema model. The agent never generates large JSON — only a small `scalar_fields` dict.
- **`table_array_field`**: Schema field name for the table array (e.g., `"transactions"`)
- **`scalar_fields`**: Non-table fields (e.g., `{"statement_period": "Jan 2025"}`)

### Page Markers and Batch Extraction

When processing multi-page documents, the service inserts page boundary markers between page texts:

```
--- PAGE 1 ---
Account Number: 12345
Statement Period: January 2025

| Date | Description | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 01/15 | Deposit | 3500.00 |
--- PAGE 2 ---
| 01/16 | ATM | -200.00 |
| 01/20 | Transfer | -1500.00 |
```

**Page marker format**: `--- PAGE {N} ---` (1-indexed)

The table parser transparently skips page markers inside tables — they do not break table continuity or appear in parsed rows.

**Sharded concurrent extraction** (`max_concurrent_batches > 1`): the section's
pages are split into **token-budgeted page ranges**, and each shard's prompt
contains **only that shard's OCR text and images** — not the whole document. The
shards run concurrently (up to `max_concurrent_batches` at a time) and their
results are merged. This serves two purposes:

1. **Bounds the context window.** Because each agent sees only its pages, a long
   or dense section that would overflow a single agent's context (the failure
   mode behind `ContextWindowOverflowException`) is split until each shard fits.
2. **Reduces wall-clock time** via parallelism.

Key behaviors:
- **Bounded by tokens AND pages.** Pages are grouped so each shard's estimated
  input stays under `shard_token_budget` (default **8,000**; `≈ chars/4`) **and**
  holds at most `max_pages_per_shard` pages (default **5**, `0` disables the page
  ceiling). A shard closes when *either* bound is hit. The page ceiling
  guarantees a large document shards even when its OCR text is unusually compact
  and would otherwise fit one token budget — so sharding engages **by default**
  with no per-config tuning. `max_concurrent_batches` is an **upper bound on
  parallelism and shard count** — a very large section is split into as many
  shards as needed to fit (capped at `max_concurrent_batches`), not exactly N
  equal pieces.
  > **Why the low default budget?** A high budget (the old 40,000 default) let
  > even a ~25-page dense table fit one shard, so sharding silently did *not*
  > engage and a single agent had to emit the whole giant table in one Bedrock
  > call → read timeout. 8,000 + a 5-page ceiling reliably shard large docs so
  > each agent's work stays bounded. Raise `shard_token_budget` for
  > large-context (`:1m`) models if you want fewer, larger shards.
- **Page-aligned splits keep table rows intact.** A table spans pages but each
  row lives on one page, so splits fall between rows; list fields are
  concatenated in page order on merge (no row loss/duplication).
- **Header context propagation.** The section's first-page text is prepended to
  every later shard (clearly marked "for context only") so column headers and
  page-1 scalar context survive the split.
- **Scalar merge.** Each shard extracts what it can see; scalars take the
  **first non-null** value across shards. If two shards disagree on a scalar, the
  first is kept and the conflict is recorded in `metadata.shard_scalar_conflicts`.

> If a single shard's input *still* exceeds the model context window, extraction
> raises a clear, actionable error (enable table parsing / lower
> `shard_token_budget` / use a larger-context `:1m` model) rather than the
> opaque Strands "insufficient messages for summarization" message.

```yaml
# Enable sharded concurrent extraction (up to 4 shards in parallel)
extraction:
  agentic:
    enabled: true
    max_concurrent_batches: 4
    shard_token_budget: 8000    # default; lower if shards still overflow, raise for 1M-context models
    max_pages_per_shard: 5      # default; page ceiling so large docs always shard (0 = disable)
    table_parsing:
      enabled: true
```

**Document-size guidance.** The defaults above are tuned to work without
hand-tuning on large documents (validated at scale on 100- and 200-page
single- and multi-table PDFs). For very large documents (100+ pages) prefer the
Step Functions Distributed Map runtime (`runtime: step_functions`) so each shard
runs in its own Lambda and the section is not bound by the single-Lambda 15-min
ceiling; the in-process runtime still shards correctly but a 200-page section may
approach that ceiling.

### ExtractionRuntime: pluggable orchestration over shared primitives

Sharding is factored into runtime-agnostic primitives in
`idp_common.extraction.runtime` so the **same** shard/merge logic runs whether
you call the library from a notebook, a CLI, a single Lambda, or a production
Step Functions Distributed Map — one implementation, no behaviour divergence.

**Primitives (the single source of truth):**

- `extract_one_shard(...)` — runs ONE shard's agent (via an injected
  `shard_runner`; `agentic_idp.default_shard_runner` in production) and is
  **idempotent**: if a `ShardPersistence` backend already holds a complete
  result for the shard's page range, it is loaded and returned instead of
  re-inferring. This is the asyncio task body AND the SFN Map iteration body.
- `merge_shard_results(...)` / `merge_shard_dicts(...)` — concatenate list fields
  in page order and take first-non-null scalars (recording conflicts).
- `ShardPersistence` protocol + `S3ShardPersistence`, keyed at
  `checkpoints/{execution_arn}/{section_id}/shards/shard_{start}_{end}.json`.

**Two backends behind the `ExtractionRuntime` interface:**

- **`InProcessRuntime`** (default) — plans shards, runs them via `asyncio.gather`
  + a semaphore, then merges. This is what a notebook / CLI / single Lambda uses;
  **sharding works fully here with no Step Functions dependency.**
  `ExtractionService.process_document_section()` routes its concurrent path
  through this runtime, so standalone usage is unchanged.
- **`StepFunctionsRuntime`** (production) — a nested SFN **Distributed Map** where
  each iteration is a thin shard Lambda calling `extract_one_shard` (one fresh
  15-minute Lambda per shard) and a following merge state calls
  `merge_shard_results`. Because each shard persists its result idempotently to
  S3, SFN's **native per-iteration retry re-runs only the failed/incomplete
  shards** — completed shards load from S3, with no custom near-timeout/reentry
  code and no 15-minute ceiling for the section as a whole.

Select the backend with `extraction.agentic.runtime` (`in_process` default, or
`step_functions`); the `EXTRACTION_RUNTIME` env var and an explicit `override`
argument also work. The in-process section Lambda additionally wires
`S3ShardPersistence`, so even on the in-process path an SFN `ExtractionStep`
retry of a timed-out section resumes only the incomplete shards.

**Standalone usage (plain Python, no SFN):**

```python
from idp_common.extraction import ExtractionService
service = ExtractionService(config=config)            # config.extraction.agentic.max_concurrent_batches > 1
doc = service.process_document_section(document, section_id)   # shards + merges in-process
```

See `notebooks/misc/standalone_sharded_extraction_demo.py` for a runnable
demonstration (offline with a fake agent; live with real Bedrock).

### Confidence Assessment (in-shard confidence & bounding boxes)

> **Config v0.6:** confidence scoring is an **output of extraction** — its settings
> live under `extraction.confidence` (was the top-level `assessment` block) and
> geometry under `extraction.geometry` (was `assessment.geometry_mode`). HITL moved
> to the top-level `hitl` block. Old configs are migrated on read.

Per-field confidence/bbox **assessment can run inside extraction** instead of as a
separate downstream step, controlled by `extraction.confidence.mode`:

```yaml
extraction:
  confidence:
    enabled: true                     # master on/off — false disables confidence entirely
    mode: separate                    # "separate" (default) | "integrated"
    model: us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
    list_batch_size: 25               # rows scored per inference (agentic in-shard)
  geometry:
    mode: ocr_only                    # ocr_only (default) | llm_grounded | llm | off
  agentic:
    enabled: true
    max_concurrent_batches: 4         # sharded; confidence scoring runs per-shard
hitl:
  enabled: false                      # route low-confidence fields to human review
  confidence_threshold: 0.8
```

- **`separate`** (default, **no behavior change on upgrade**): extraction and
  assessment are distinct inferences.
  - *Agentic*: after each shard extracts, a **second assessment inference runs
    inside that same shard** over the shard's pages/values — so assessment
    inherits the same per-shard scaling as extraction (a 200-page section never
    assesses in one oversized call). Per-shard assessments are collated on merge
    (per-field, **page-ordered for list items**, first-shard-wins for scalars),
    grounded once in real OCR geometry over the whole section, and emitted as
    `explainability_info` — byte-for-byte the same output the standalone
    Assessment step produces.
  - *Non-agentic*: unchanged — the pipeline flows to the standalone Assessment
    step exactly as before.
- **`integrated`**: confidence is produced **within the extraction inference
  itself** — the document is already in context, so there is no separate
  assessment request and no re-sent document. The inline result rides the **same**
  collation → post-merge reconcile → OCR grounding → `explainability_info` path as
  `separate`, so the output contract is identical; only the source of the
  confidence differs. The `extraction.confidence` model/prompt settings are unused,
  and the standalone Assessment step is bypassed (auto-skips once
  `explainability_info` is present).
  - *Agentic*: the agent emits confidence via a tool call (see the strategy knob
    below).
  - *Non-agentic (simple)*: the single extraction inference is prompted to return
    values **and** a parallel confidence structure as
    `{"extraction": {...}, "confidence": {...}}`; the service splits that envelope
    (values → `inference_result`, confidence → the same in-extraction marker),
    enriches it with per-field `confidence_threshold` + alerts, reconciles, grounds,
    and emits `explainability_info`. If the model returns a flat response with no
    confidence envelope, the path **falls back to the standalone Assessment step**
    (no data loss). Best for **smaller documents** where one inference comfortably
    holds the whole doc; for large docs prefer agentic (sharded) or `separate`.
  - **Missing-row robustness (both paths):** because integrated confidence rides on
    the extraction call, a model can under-score a large table. After reconcile,
    any list rows left unscored are **retried in focused, bounded re-assessment
    calls** (only the missing rows) and spliced back — so large-list confidence
    coverage reaches 100% rather than leaving null placeholders. Best for
    cost/latency once you've confirmed your model produces well-calibrated inline
    confidence; otherwise prefer `separate` (a dedicated assessment inference).

  <a id="integrated-confidence-strategy"></a>
  **Hidden setting — `extraction.agentic.integrated_confidence_strategy` (experimental).**
  For the *agentic* path, integrated confidence can be produced two ways. This knob
  is **not surfaced in the config UI** — it exists so operators can A/B the
  cost/latency-vs-calibration trade-off before we pick a default. Set it via
  `idp-cli config-upload` on a throwaway config version; both values produce
  identical `explainability_info` downstream (only the inference mechanics differ):

  | value | how confidence is produced | inferences per turn/shard (happy path) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `two_step` *(default)* | the agent extracts via the extraction tool, then calls `provide_field_assessment` in a **follow-up inference** within the same turn — a dedicated reflection pass over the finalized values | 3 (extract → assess → close) |
  | `single_shot` | the agent emits values **and** per-field confidence in **one combined tool call** (`extraction_with_confidence_tool`), saving the follow-up inference | 2 (extract+confidence → close) |

  Why it is not one inference either way: agentic extraction is delivered via a
  *tool call*, and the tool-use protocol ends an inference at each tool call, so a
  final "close the turn" inference is always required after the last tool result.
  `single_shot` removes the *middle* (assessment) inference, not the close. It
  reuses the same prompt cache as `two_step` (the document/system/tools prefix is
  written once and read by the closing inference). Trade-off: `two_step` gives the
  model a dedicated look at the finalized extraction before scoring (often
  better-calibrated confidence); `single_shot` is cheaper/faster but scores inline
  as it extracts. For large/multi-step (patched) extractions where rows are added
  after the combined call, the agent may still call `provide_field_assessment` once
  at the end to (re)assess every row (rows never assessed are padded with neutral
  `confidence: null`, same as today). Non-agentic (simple) integrated is always a
  true single inference and is unaffected by this knob.

**Standalone Assessment step bypass.** When in-shard (or integrated) assessment
has already written `explainability_info` to the section result, the downstream
Assessment Lambda detects it and **skips its own inference** (a cheap
pass-through) — so no duplicate assessment cost and no state-machine change. When
`extraction.confidence.enabled: false`, confidence scoring is skipped everywhere. The document status
remains `EXTRACTING` while in-shard assessment runs (it *is* part of the extraction
step).

**List alignment guarantee.** Downstream consumers index
`explainability_info[0][field][i]` against `inference_result[field][i]`, but an
assessment LLM often returns a *different* number of row assessments than the
table has rows (e.g. 44 assessments for 120 extracted rows). In-shard assessment
**reconciles each list field's assessment to exactly match the extracted row
count** (truncating extras, padding shortfalls with a neutral `confidence: null`
"not individually assessed" entry) *before* the per-shard merge — so confidence is
never misattributed to the wrong row and the drift never compounds across shards.

**Reuse, not duplication.** In-shard assessment calls the **same**
`AssessmentService.assess_results(...)` core the standalone step uses (extracted
into a pure, S3-free method) and the same `ocr_grounding.ground_assessment_geometry`
— so confidence scoring, thresholds, alerts, and geometry grounding are identical;
only the *where it runs* differs. The output contract (`explainability_info[0]` +
`section.confidence_threshold_alerts`) is unchanged, so HITL, the UI confidence
display, evaluation, and reporting all consume it as before.

### Configuration Options

#### `max_empty_line_gap` (integer, 0-10, default: 3)
Maximum consecutive empty lines to tolerate within a table before treating as table boundary. Higher values increase tolerance for OCR page breaks but may merge unrelated tables.

**Tuning guidance**:
- **High-quality OCR** (Textract LAYOUT): Use 2
- **Standard quality**: Use 3 (default)
- **Low-quality or complex documents**: Use 5-7
- **Multiple similar tables close together**: Use 1-2

#### `auto_merge_adjacent_tables` (boolean, default: true)
Automatically merge consecutive tables with identical column structure. Recovers from table splits caused by OCR artifacts like page breaks.

**When to disable**:
- Documents contain multiple distinct tables with same columns
- Need to preserve table boundaries for semantic reasons

#### `min_confidence_threshold` (float, 0-100, default: 95.0)
Minimum average OCR confidence (Textract scale) for agent to prefer table parsing over LLM extraction. Only applies when using Textract OCR backend.

#### `min_parse_success_rate` (float, 0-1, default: 0.90)
Minimum parse success rate for agent to trust parsed results. Below this threshold, agent should fall back to LLM extraction.

### Schema-Constraint Validation and Model Escalation

Agentic extraction always validates the agent's output against the **Pydantic
model** generated from the class JSON Schema (`field_constraints=True`), so
`enum`, `pattern`, numeric bounds and `minItems`/`maxItems` violations are fed
back to the agent for self-correction during extraction.

The optional `extraction.agentic.validation` block adds **full JSON-Schema
validation** of the final result — most importantly the `format` keyword
(`date`, `date-time`, `email`, `uri`, `uuid`, ...), which the generated Pydantic
model does **not** enforce — and an optional **bounded model escalation** when
validation still fails.

```yaml
extraction:
  agentic:
    enabled: true
    validation:
      enabled: false          # Off by default (no behavior change on upgrade)
      check_formats: true     # Enforce JSON-Schema 'format' keywords
      fail_action: escalate   # warn | escalate | reject
      escalation_model: "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8"  # stronger tier; "" = retry same model
```

How it works:

1. After extraction, the merged result is validated against the full class
   schema. All violations are collected at once (not one-at-a-time) with
   human-readable field paths.
2. `fail_action` controls the response when validation fails:
   - **`warn`** — record a `validation` block in the result metadata and proceed.
   - **`escalate`** — re-extract **only the failing top-level fields** with a
     stronger model (`escalation_model`), then merge the corrected fields back
     into the result. Scoping to the failing fields keeps the schema, prompt and
     output small — far cheaper and faster than re-running the whole section —
     and the fields that already validated are preserved untouched. The merged
     result is kept only if it is valid or has strictly fewer violations; then
     warn if it still fails. (When the failures can't be expressed as a field
     subset — e.g. they're root-level only — it falls back to a whole-section
     re-extraction.)
   - **`reject`** — mark `parsing_succeeded=false` so downstream/HITL can act.
3. The outcome is recorded under `metadata.validation` (see *Audit metadata*
   below).

**Audit metadata.** Each section's extraction result records, under `metadata`:
- `extraction_model` and `extraction_model_overridden` — the model that actually
  ran the section and whether it came from a per-class override.
- `metadata.validation` — `valid`, `error_count`, `failed_fields`, `errors`
  (path + validator + message), `check_formats`, `fail_action`,
  `initial_error_count` / `initial_failed_fields` (before any escalation), and —
  when escalation ran — `escalated`, `escalation_model`, `escalation_scope`
  (`field-subset` | `full-section`), `escalation_fields`, and
  `resolved_by_escalation`.
- `metadata.population_check` — completeness heuristic (advisory). Reports
  `fields_defined`, `fields_populated`, `population_ratio`, `below_threshold`,
  and `empty_fields` (dotted paths of unpopulated leaves). A warning is logged
  when the ratio falls below `validation.min_population_ratio` (default `0.5`).
  This catches *silent* extraction loss — e.g. nested fields returning null, or
  a table that extracted zero rows — that schema validation alone cannot, since
  sparse-but-valid output is still schema-valid. It never fails extraction (a
  genuinely sparse document scores low too); set `min_population_ratio: 0` to
  silence the warning.

**Escalation model precedence:** per-class `x-aws-idp-extraction-escalation-model`
schema extension → global `validation.escalation_model` → the extraction model
itself (escalation becomes a plain second attempt).

**Configuration UI.** The global `validation` block (enabled / check_formats /
fail_action / escalation_model) is editable under **Extraction → Agentic
Extraction → Schema Validation & Escalation** in the Configuration editor. The
per-class `x-aws-idp-extraction-escalation-model` override is editable as
"Escalation Model Override" in the **Document Schema** editor, next to the
per-class extraction-model override.

**Null = absent.** Extraction follows the convention "return `null` if a field is
not found", and the generated Pydantic model makes every non-required property
`Optional[...] = None`. Validation therefore treats a `null` property as
**absent**: an optional field left null passes, while a *required* field left
null surfaces as a `required` violation (not a confusing type error). Enum /
pattern / format / numeric / `minItems` checks on present values are unaffected.

> **`format: date` caveat.** JSON-Schema `format: date` means ISO-8601
> (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The default extraction prompt asks the model for `MM/DD/YYYY`,
> which is **not** a valid `date` format and will fail format validation. If
> your schema uses `format: date` for non-ISO dates, either set
> `check_formats: false` or use a `pattern` instead of `format`.

### Benefits

- **Faster extraction**: Deterministic parsing is faster than LLM inference for well-structured tables
- **Higher accuracy**: Eliminates LLM hallucination for tabular data
- **Better completeness**: Intelligent recovery from OCR artifacts prevents data loss
- **Cost reduction**: Reduces token usage for large tables
- **Hybrid flexibility**: Agent intelligently chooses between parsing and LLM based on quality

### OCR Backend Compatibility

The table parsing tool works with any OCR backend producing Markdown tables:

| OCR Backend | Markdown Support | Confidence Data | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Textract** (TABLES) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Best for structured tables |
| **Textract** (LAYOUT) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Handles complex layouts |
| **Bedrock OCR** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Tool uses parse_success_rate only |
| **Chandra OCR** | ✅ Yes (markdown mode) | ❌ No | High-quality Markdown output |

When OCR confidence data is unavailable, the tool relies on `parse_success_rate` and column consistency for quality assessment.

### Example: Bank Statement with 1000+ Transactions

```yaml
# config.yaml
extraction:
  model: "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"
  agentic:
    enabled: true
    table_parsing:
      enabled: true
      max_empty_line_gap: 5  # Handle multi-page statements
      auto_merge_adjacent_tables: true

classes:
  - $id: BankStatement
    type: object
    properties:
      account_number:
        type: string
      statement_period:
        type: string
      transactions:
        type: array
        minItems: 1000  # Completeness validation
        items:
          type: object
          properties:
            date: {type: string}
            description: {type: string}
            amount: {type: number}
            balance: {type: number}
```

**Extraction flow**:
1. Agent identifies transaction table in OCR text
2. Calls `parse_table(table_text)` → Returns 1020 rows with quality metrics
3. Tool warnings: "ℹ️ Successfully recovered 3 gaps in table data"
4. Calls `map_table_to_schema(column_mapping={"Date": "date", "Description": "description", ...}, value_transforms={"amount": "strip_currency"})` → All 1020 rows transformed instantly
5. Calls `finalize_table_extraction(table_array_field="transactions", scalar_fields={"account_number": "12345678", "statement_period": "January 2024"})` → Validated against Pydantic model
6. Completeness check logs: "Extraction exceeds minimum constraint: 'transactions' has 1020 items (minimum: 1000)"

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Agent extracts only 900 records instead of 1020

**Root causes & solutions**:
1. **Table split by empty lines** → Increase `max_empty_line_gap` to 5
2. **Multiple table fragments** → Ensure `auto_merge_adjacent_tables: true`
3. **Agent stopped early** → Check extraction logs for timeout/retry issues
4. **Schema constraint too strict** → Reduce `minItems` or make it optional

**Problem**: Parse quality is low (< 0.90)

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve OCR quality** → Use Textract LAYOUT or Chandra OCR
2. **Complex table structure** → Use LLM extraction instead of parse_table
3. **Merged cells or nested headers** → Preprocess table or use LLM

**Problem**: Unrelated tables being merged

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `max_empty_line_gap` to 1-2
2. Set `auto_merge_adjacent_tables: false`
3. Add more context to distinguish tables semantically

### Observability

Extraction results include table parsing metadata when the tool is used:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "extraction_method": "agentic",
    "table_parsing_tool_used": true,
    "table_parsing_stats": {
      "tables_parsed": 1,
      "rows_parsed": 1020,
      "parse_success_rate": 0.98,
      "avg_confidence": 96.5,
      "confidence_available": true,
      "invocation_count": 1
    }
  }
}
```

When a section is sharded across concurrent agents, each shard contributes its own
`table_parsing_stats` and they are merged with quality-aware semantics (not summed):
counts (`tables_parsed`, `rows_parsed`, `rows_mapped`, `invocation_count`) add up,
while `parse_success_rate` and `avg_confidence` are combined as **row-weighted
averages** so the reported values stay a real 0-1 rate / 0-100 confidence regardless
of shard count.

Use these metrics to:
- Identify documents where table parsing is working well
- Detect quality issues requiring configuration tuning
- Measure cost savings vs LLM-only extraction
