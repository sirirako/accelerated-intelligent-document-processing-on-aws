"""Tests for ``ensure_artifacts_bucket`` S3 Block Public Access (BPA) behaviour.

These guard the security contract that pack publishing is **private by
default** and only opens a bucket to the world when ``make_public=True`` is
explicitly requested — and that a *pre-existing* bucket's BPA settings are
never weakened (so a manual security remediation can't be silently reverted
by a publish run).
