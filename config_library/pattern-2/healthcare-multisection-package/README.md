- Medical and clinical information (group attributes)
- Service line items and charges (list attributes)
- Insurance and payment details (group attributes)

## Key Components

### Document Classes

The configuration defines **10 document classes** with comprehensive nested attributes:

#### 1. Health-Insurance-Claim-Form (CMS-1500 Style)
Standard health insurance claim form for processing medical claims.
- **Group Attributes**: PatientInformation, MedicalInformation, PaymentInformation, InsuredInformation, OtherInsuredInformation, EmploymentInformation, InsurancePlanInformation, PhysicianInformation
- **List Attributes**: ServiceInformation (Date-of-Service, Procedures, Charges, Diagnosis-Code, etc.)

#### 2. DischargeSummary

- **Group Attributes**: InvoiceDetails (Date, InvoiceNumber), BillTo (Name, Address), HospitalInformation, Summary (Subtotal, Tax, Discount, Total), PaymentInstructions
- **List Attributes**: Charges (Description, Amount per line item)

#### 9. Surgical-Pathology-Report
Surgical pathology report for patients with various conditions.
- **Group Attributes**: Report-Details (Accession-Number, Patient, MRN, DOB, Procedure, Attending), Header, Specimen-Details, Gross-Description, Clinical-History, Diagnosis, Immunostains, Microscopic-Description, Comment

#### 10. Prescription
Prescription form for medication documentation.
- **Group Attributes**: PrescriptionDetails (FacilityName, RxNumber, MedicationName, MedicationDosage, Quantity, DaysSupply, Refills, FillDate, RefillDate)

### Attribute Types Demonstration

This configuration demonstrates **Group Attributes** and **List Attributes** at the document class level. All top-level properties in each document class use `$ref` to reference nested object definitions.

#### 1. Group Attributes
All document classes use group attributes (nested object structures) for their top-level properties:
- **PatientInformation**: Patient demographics and contact details
- **PaymentInformation**: Financial details including charges and payments
- **InsuranceDetails**: Insurance plan and member information
- **PhysicianInformation**: Provider details and signatures
- **HeaderInformation**: Document header and metadata
- **ClaimDetails**: Claim-specific information

#### 2. List Attributes
Arrays of repeating records for line-item data:
- **ServiceInformation**: Individual service line items on claim forms (Health-Insurance-Claim-Form)
- **Charges**: Line-item charges on invoices (Medical-Insurance-Invoice)

#### 3. Simple Attributes (Within Group Definitions)
Simple attributes exist **within** the group definitions (`$defs`), not at the document class level:
- **Patient-Name**: Full name of the patient (FUZZY evaluation)
- **Insured-ID-Number**: Unique identifiers (EXACT evaluation)
- **Patient-Birth-Date**: Date fields (EXACT evaluation with date format)
- **Total-Charge**: Payment amounts (EXACT evaluation)

### Evaluation Methods

The configuration uses multiple evaluation methods tailored to data types:

| Method | Usage | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| EXACT | Identifiers, codes, precise values | Account numbers, IDs, ZIP codes |
| FUZZY | Names, addresses, variable text | Patient names, addresses, hospital names |
| LLM | Complex descriptions, clinical text | Medical history, diagnoses, symptoms |

### Classification Settings

- **Model**: Amazon Nova Pro
- **Method**: Text-based holistic classification
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)
- **Top-k**: 5

The classification component analyzes document packages to identify document type boundaries and classify each section appropriately across all 10 document types.

### Extraction Settings

- **Model**: Amazon Nova Pro
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)
- **Top-k**: 5
- **Document Image Support**: Uses `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder for multimodal extraction

The extraction component processes each document section to extract structured data including nested group information and list attributes.

### Assessment Settings

- **Model**: Amazon Nova Pro
- **Default Confidence Threshold**: 0.8
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)

The assessment component evaluates extraction confidence for each attribute, including nested structures and array items.

### Evaluation Settings

- **Model**: Claude 3 Haiku (for LLM evaluations)
- **Evaluation Methods**:
  - EXACT: For IDs, account numbers, codes, dates
  - FUZZY: For names, addresses, descriptions
  - LLM: For clinical narratives and complex medical text

## Key Differences from Default Configuration

### 1. Multi-Document Type Support

This configuration supports 10 distinct document types commonly found in healthcare workflows, enabling:
- Mixed document package processing where the sections vary in layout types and complexity levels
- Intelligent document classification
- Type-specific extraction schemas

### 2. Healthcare Industry Specialization

- Optimized schemas for CMS-1500 claim forms
- Structured extraction for clinical documents (discharge summaries, pathology reports)
- Insurance and billing document support
