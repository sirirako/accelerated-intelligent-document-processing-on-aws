# OmniAI OCR Benchmark Configuration

This configuration is designed for the **OmniAI OCR Benchmark dataset** from HuggingFace (`getomni-ai/ocr-benchmark`), filtered to include only the most representative document formats with consistent schemas.

## Dataset Overview

The OCR Benchmark dataset contains diverse document types with ground truth JSON extraction data. This configuration includes the **9 document formats** with the most samples (formats with >5 samples per schema), totaling **293 pre-selected images**.

## Document Classes

| Class | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **BANK_CHECK** | Bank checks with MICR encoding | checks[] (bank, personal info, payee, amount, MICR) |
| **COMMERCIAL_LEASE_AGREEMENT** | Commercial property leases | lessor/lessee info, premises, lease terms, rent |
| **CREDIT_CARD_STATEMENT** | Account statements | accountNumber, period, transactions[] |
| **DELIVERY_NOTE** | Shipping/delivery documents | header (from/to), items[] with product specs |
| **EQUIPMENT_INSPECTION** | Inspection reports | equipmentInfo, checkpoints[], overallStatus |
| **GLOSSARY** | Alphabetized term lists | title, pageNumber, glossarySections[] |
| **PETITION_FORM** | Election petition forms | header, candidate, witness, signatures[] |
| **REAL_ESTATE** | Real estate transaction data | transactions[], transactionsByCity[] |
| **SHIFT_SCHEDULE** | Employee scheduling | title, facility, employees[] with shifts |

## Benchmark Results

Evaluated on the full 293-document dataset using IDP Accelerator v0.5.0 (pattern-2, pipeline mode). Evaluation methods are identical across all configs for apples-to-apples comparison.

| Metric | Previous Config | This Config (Nova 2 Lite) | With Sonnet 4.6 |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 51.5% | 75.2% | 91.2% |
| **Classification Accuracy** | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **Total Cost (293 docs)** | $2.60 | $2.62 | $9.73 |
| **Cost per Document** | ~$0.009 | ~$0.009 | ~$0.033 |

### Per-Class Extraction Accuracy

| Class | Previous | This Config (Nova) | With Sonnet |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| DELIVERY_NOTE (8) | 89.5% | 98.9% | 99.4% |
| PETITION_FORM (51) | 74.7% | 96.7% | 98.4% |
| COMMERCIAL_LEASE_AGREEMENT (52) | 75.5% | 96.3% | 98.5% |
| SHIFT_SCHEDULE (18) | 68.9% | 95.7% | 96.0% |
| REAL_ESTATE (59) | 80.6% | 91.4% | 98.9% |
| BANK_CHECK (52) | 82.6% | 86.1% | 97.0% |
| EQUIPMENT_INSPECTION (11) | 60.8% | 83.6% | 97.1% |
| CREDIT_CARD_STATEMENT (11) | 53.1% | 74.7% | 82.3% |
| GLOSSARY (31) | 68.0% | 67.3% | 95.0% |

### Models Used

- **Classification**: Nova 2 Lite (`us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`)
- **Extraction**: Nova 2 Lite (`us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`)
- **OCR**: Textract (Layout feature)

To use Sonnet 4.6 for extraction, change `extraction.model` to `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6-20250929-v1:0`.

## Processing Mode

**Default Mode**: Pipeline (use_bda: false). Set use_bda: true for BDA mode.

## Validation Level

**Level**: 3 - Benchmarked

- **Testing Evidence**: Evaluated on the full 293-document OmniAI OCR Benchmark dataset with per-class accuracy breakdown. Evaluation methods identical to previous config for fair comparison.
- **Known Limitations**: GLOSSARY class has lower accuracy (67.3%) due to OCR challenges with single-digit numbers. Upgrading extraction model to Claude Sonnet 4.6 improves overall accuracy to 91.2% at higher cost.
