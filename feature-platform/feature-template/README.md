# Feature Template — copy this to start a new feature

This is a scaffold for building an installable IDP Accelerator subscription
feature. The recommended way to use it is via the SDK CLI:

```bash
pip install -e lib/idp_feature_sdk
idp-feature-cli init ./my-feature \
    --feature-id my-feature \
    --display-name "My Feature"
```

That copies this directory and substitutes the placeholder `featureId` /
`displayName` / `version` literals throughout. You can also `cp -r` the
whole directory and find-replace `my-feature` / `My Feature` / `0.1.0`
manually if you prefer.

    participant Dev as Developer

    participant Admin as IDP Admin
    participant Main as Main Stack

    CLI->>S3: update latest.json
    CLI-->>Dev: print Launch Stack URL

    Admin->>Main: opens "Extensions" → My Feature
    Main-->>Admin: shows InstallPrompt (admin + ACTIVE)
    Admin->>Main: clicks Launch Stack → opens CFN Console
    Admin->>Main: Create Stack
    Main->>Main: deploys feature stack
    Main->>Main: ui-deployer CR copies bundle to WebUIBucket
    Main->>Main: register-feature CR puts row in InstalledFeatures DDB
    Admin->>Main: reloads page — feature UI is now live
```

## Implementing the host contract

### UI bundle
Your `feature-ui/src/entry.tsx` **must** call:

```ts
window.IdpFeatures.register('my-feature', {
  Component: App,              // receives FeatureContext as props
  version: '0.1.0',            // must match feature.yaml -> version
  displayName: 'My Feature',
});
```

And your `feature-ui/vite.config.ts` **must** externalise React/ReactDOM/
Cloudscape/aws-amplify (see the provided example).

### Backend API (optional)
If your feature needs a backend, `template.yaml` should create an HTTP API
Gateway + Lambda(s) and output the endpoint. The ui-deployer CR reads that
output and writes it to `InstalledFeatures.featureApiEndpoint` so the
host passes it to your UI via `FeatureContext.featureApiEndpoint`.

Cognito JWT auth: the UI calls `context.getAuthToken()` to get a fresh
Bearer token — configure your API Gateway to verify against the main stack's
User Pool (import `<MainStackName>-UserPoolId`).

### Main-stack registration
Your `template.yaml` must include a `RegisterFeature` custom resource
(see `ui-deployer/handler.py`) that calls the main stack's AppSync
`registerFeature` mutation on Create/Update and `unregisterFeature` on
Delete. Without this, your feature never shows up in the UI's nav.

## Add to the catalog & publish

Adding the feature to the catalog is what makes it discoverable in the UI:

- **OSS** — add `{ path: feature-platform/<your-feature> }` to
  `config_library/extensions-oss.yaml`, then `idp-cli publish`.
- **Marketplace** — publish to your private seller bucket and add an entry to
  `config_library/extensions-marketplace.yaml`.

In the default **auto-subscribe** mode, OSS features skip the subscribe step and
go straight to **Install**.

See the full walkthrough — host contract, catalog registration for both kinds,
and local end-to-end testing — in the
[Feature Platform Developer Guide](../../docs/feature-platform-developer-guide.md).
