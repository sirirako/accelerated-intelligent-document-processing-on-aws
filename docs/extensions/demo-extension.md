# Sample: Document Status (feature add-on)

**Sample: Document Status** is the minimal *feature add-on* sample for the
[Feature Platform](../feature-platform.md) — the simplest of the two bundled
samples (its companion, the richer *use-case* sample, is
[Sample: Health Insurance Review](sample-health-insurance-review.md)). It demonstrates the host
contract end-to-end and is the recommended starting point for authoring your
own extension.

> Its `featureId` is `docs-by-status` (unchanged); only the display name was
> updated to make its role as a sample obvious in the nav.

## What it does

Adds a **Document Status** page to the IDP web UI: a pie chart showing how many
documents are currently in each processing status — NEW, QUEUED, RUNNING,
COMPLETED, FAILED. Counts are fetched live from the main stack's document
tracking table through a small feature-owned HTTP API.

## How it works

It exercises every part of the host contract, making it a complete, working
template:

- **UI bundle** — a React UMD module rendered inside the host UI, sharing the
  host's React/Cloudscape instances via `window.IdpFeatures.register(...)`.
- **Backend API** — an HTTP API + Lambda that reads the main stack's
  `TrackingTable` (granted a scoped cross-stack read role) and returns
  per-status counts. The UI calls it with a Cognito-issued bearer token.
- **Registration** — a `RegisterFeature` custom resource registers the feature
  with the host on stack create and unregisters on delete, so it appears in the
  **Extensions** nav automatically.

## Installing

This sample is bundled with the accelerator and listed in the catalog, so it
appears under **Extensions** in the nav (as **Sample: Document Status (feature
add-on)**) as soon as the Feature Platform is enabled (the default). An admin
installs it from its feature page with one click — there's no subscription step
for open-source extensions.
