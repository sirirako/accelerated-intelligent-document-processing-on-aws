# Code Intelligence Agent

The GenAIIDP solution includes a Code Intelligence Agent that provides intelligent codebase understanding and analysis capabilities through the [Agent Companion Chat](./agent-companion-chat.md). This agent enables developers and users to interactively explore, understand, and analyze complex codebases using natural language queries, making code comprehension and maintenance significantly more efficient.

## Overview

The Code Intelligence Agent is one of several specialized sub-agents available within the Agent Companion Chat's multi-agent orchestration system. When enabled, the orchestrator can route code-related questions to this agent, which provides comprehensive codebase analysis and understanding capabilities through:

- **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Natural language queries about codebase structure, functionality, and architecture
- **File System Management**: Efficient handling of large codebases with smart caching and filtering
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent chat sessions via the Agent Companion Chat's DynamoDB-backed conversation history
- **Lambda Integration**: Serverless deployment with automatic codebase extraction and initialization
- **Multi-Format Support**: Support for various file types including Python, JavaScript, Jupyter notebooks, and more
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Deep technical analysis with accurate code references and examples
- **Real-time Code Exploration**: Interactive exploration of codebase components and relationships

## How It Fits Into Agent Companion Chat

The Code Intelligence Agent operates as an **optional sub-agent** within the Agent Companion Chat's orchestrator system:

```
User → Agent Companion Chat → Orchestrator Agent
                                  ├── Analytics Agent
                                  ├── Error Analyzer Agent
                                  ├── Code Intelligence Agent (Optional - toggle controlled)
                                  └── External MCP Agents (Optional)
```

- The **Orchestrator Agent** automatically routes code-related queries to the Code Intelligence Agent when it is enabled
- Users control whether the agent is active via the **Code Intelligence toggle** in the chat interface
- When disabled, the orchestrator will not route any queries to this agent
- The agent shares the same conversation memory, streaming infrastructure, and UI as all other companion chat agents

For full details on the Agent Companion Chat architecture, session management, streaming, and multi-agent orchestration, see the [Agent Companion Chat documentation](./agent-companion-chat.md).

## ⚠️ Security and Privacy

**IMPORTANT: The Code Intelligence Agent uses third-party MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers (DeepWiki), which means your queries may be sent to external services not controlled by AWS or your organization.**

- When Code Intelligence is **enabled**, queries routed to this agent may be sent to external services
- Data sent to these services is subject to their privacy policies and terms of service
- **Keep Code Intelligence disabled by default** unless you specifically need code assistance
- **Do NOT share** sensitive information (credentials, account IDs, proprietary data, customer information) in queries when this agent is enabled
- Use the Analytics Agent or Error Analyzer Agent for queries involving your actual system data — those agents operate entirely within your AWS account

For detailed security guidance and best practices, see the [Security and Privacy section](./agent-companion-chat.md#security-and-privacy) in the Agent Companion Chat documentation.

## File System Architecture

### Current Implementation (Lambda /tmp)

The Code Intelligence feature currently uses the Lambda function's `/tmp` directory for codebase storage:

**Advantages:**
- **Fast Access**: Direct file system access with minimal latency
- **Simple Implementation**: No additional infrastructure required
- **Cost Effective**: No additional storage costs beyond Lambda execution

**Limitations:**
- **Size Constraints**: Limited to 10GB total storage in `/tmp`
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Files are lost when Lambda container is recycled
- **Cold Start Impact**: Codebase extraction required on each cold start

**Current Workflow:**
1. **Initialization**: Codebase zip files are extracted to `/tmp/codebase` on Lambda startup
2. **Processing**: Agent tools read files directly from the `/tmp` directory
3. **Caching**: Overview and hash files are stored in `/tmp/output` for performance
4. **Cleanup**: Temporary files are automatically cleaned up when Lambda container terminates

### Future Implementation (EFS Integration)

Planned migration to Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for enhanced scalability:

**Planned Advantages:**
- **Persistent Storage**: Codebase files persist across Lambda invocations
- **Larger Capacity**: Support for much larger codebases (petabyte scale)
- **Shared Access**: Multiple Lambda instances can access the same codebase
- **Faster Cold Starts**: No need to extract codebase on each cold start

## Configuration

### Model Selection

The Code Intelligence Agent uses the model configured for the Agent Companion Chat orchestrator. See the [Agent Companion Chat Configuration](./agent-companion-chat.md#configuration) for supported models and settings.

### Infrastructure Components

The Code Intelligence Agent shares infrastructure with the Agent Companion Chat:

- **DynamoDB Tables**: `ChatMessagesTable` (message storage) and `ChatMemoryTable` (conversation history)
- **Lambda Functions**: `agent_chat_resolver` (entry point) and `agent_chat_processor` (agent execution)
- **AppSync Resolvers**: Shared GraphQL API endpoints for real-time streaming
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for secure operation

### Code Intelligence-Specific Settings

- **CODEBASE_DIR**: Root directory for codebase files
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: Directory for generated outputs and cache
- **CONTEXT_WINDOW_SIZE**: Maximum context window size in characters
- **MAX_FILE_SIZE**: Maximum individual file size (2MB default)
- **MAX_NOTEBOOK_SIZE**: Maximum notebook size (2GB default)

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

1. **Start with Overview**: Begin with general architecture questions before diving into specifics
2. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what aspect of the code you want to understand
3. **Use Context**: Reference previous responses to build deeper understanding
4. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous answers to explore topics in depth — the Agent Companion Chat remembers the last 20 turns of conversation

### Effective Code Exploration

1. **Understand Structure First**: Ask about overall architecture before specific implementations
2. **Focus on Key Components**: Identify and explore the most important modules first
3. **Trace Data Flow**: Follow how data moves through the system
4. **Explore Patterns**: Understand common patterns and design principles used

### Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Disabled by Default**: Only enable Code Intelligence when you specifically need code assistance
2. **Review Your Questions**: Ensure queries contain no sensitive information before sending
3. **Use Other Agents for System Data**: Use Analytics or Error Analyzer agents for queries involving your actual system data
4. **Disable After Use**: Toggle Code Intelligence off when you're done with code-related questions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Code Intelligence Toggle Not Available:**
- Verify Code Intelligence is configured in your deployment
- Contact your administrator if the feature should be available

**Agent Not Responding to Code Questions:**
- Ensure the Code Intelligence toggle is **enabled** in the chat interface
- Check CloudWatch logs for the `agent_chat_processor` Lambda function
- Verify Bedrock model access is enabled for your selected model

**File Reading Errors:**
- Verify codebase zip files are present in the expected location
- Check file permissions and encoding issues
- Monitor file size limits and context window constraints
- Review ignore patterns to ensure relevant files are not excluded

**Memory and Performance Issues:**
- Monitor Lambda memory usage and increase if necessary
- Check context window limits for large file analysis
- Use high-level overview mode for codebases with 300+ files
- Consider breaking complex queries into smaller, focused questions

### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Check `/aws/lambda/agent_chat_processor` for agent execution logs
- **DynamoDB Console**: View conversation history in `ChatMessagesTable` and `ChatMemoryTable`
- **Agent Messages**: Real-time display of agent reasoning and tool usage in the chat interface

## Cost Considerations

The Code Intelligence Agent shares infrastructure costs with the Agent Companion Chat:

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Model inference costs for code analysis processing
- **AWS Lambda**: Shared function execution costs with other companion chat agents
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Shared storage costs for conversation history and memory

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Enable Only When Needed**: Keep Code Intelligence disabled when not actively using it
2. **Efficient Queries**: Ask focused questions to minimize processing time
3. **Caching Utilization**: Leverage codebase overview caching to reduce repeated analysis
4. **Session Management**: Start new chat sessions when switching topics to reduce context size
