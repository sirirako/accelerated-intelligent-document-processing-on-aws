# Test Studio

The Test Studio provides a comprehensive interface for managing test sets, running tests, and analyzing results directly from the web UI.

## Overview

The Test Studio consists of two main tabs:
1. **Test Sets**: Create and manage reusable collections of test documents
2. **Test Executions**: Execute tests, view results, and compare test runs

## Pre-Deployed Test Sets

The accelerator automatically deploys **four benchmark datasets** from HuggingFace as ready-to-use test sets during stack deployment:

1. **RealKIE-FCC-Verified**: 75 FCC invoice documents
2. **OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark**: 293 diverse document images across 9 formats
3. **DocSplit-Poly-Seq**: 500 multi-page packets with 13 document types
4. **Fake-W2-Tax-Forms**: 2,000 synthetic US W-2 tax form images with 45-field ground truth

All datasets are deployed automatically with zero manual steps required. Each test set has a corresponding **managed configuration version** (e.g., `fake-w2`, `docsplit`) that is auto-selected in Test Studio when the test set is chosen. See [Configuration — Managed Configuration Versions](configuration.md#managed-configuration-versions) for details.

### DocSplit-Poly-Seq

**DocSplit Dataset**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon/doc_split  
**Documents Source**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp

The DocSplit dataset contains 500 multi-page packet PDFs created by combining pages from 13 different document types. Documents are sourced from the RVL-CDIP-N-MP dataset. Each packet contains multiple subdocuments of different types to test classification and document splitting capabilities.

#### Benchmark Methodology

**DocSplit-Poly-Seq (Multi Category Documents Concatenation Sequentially):** Creates document packets by first determining a target page count (5-20 pages), then sequentially selecting documents from different categories without repetition. For each selected document, all of its pages are included while preserving the original page ordering, and this process continues until the target page count is reached.

This benchmark simulates the most common real-world scenario where heterogeneous documents are assembled into packets, as observed in medical claims processing where prescription records, laboratory results, and insurance forms are concatenated. The varying document types test models' ability to detect inter-document boundaries based on content and structural transitions, a fundamental requirement for accurate packet splitting.

#### Document Types

The dataset includes 13 document types spanning common business and administrative documents:
- **invoice**, **email**, **form**, **letter**, **memo**, **resume**
- **budget**, **news article**, **scientific publication**, **specification**
- **questionnaire**, **handwritten**, **language** (non-English documents)

#### Packet Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Document Packets | 500 |
| Total Pages | 7,330 |
| Total Sections | 2,027 |
| Avg Pages/Packet | 14.7 |

```

## Test Sets

### Creating Test Sets
1. **Pattern-based**: Define file patterns (e.g., `*.pdf`) with bucket type selection
   - **Input Bucket**: Scan main processing bucket for matching files
   - **Test Set Bucket**: Scan dedicated test set bucket for matching files
   - **Description**: Optional description field to document the test set purpose
   - **Modified after filter**: Optional time filter to include only recently modified files — choose a preset (Last 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, etc.) or pick a custom date/time (useful for incremental workflows)
2. **Zip Upload**: Upload zip containing `input/` and `baseline/` folders
   - **Description**: Optional description field to document the test set purpose
3. **Direct Upload**: Files uploaded directly to TestSetBucket are auto-detected

### Adding Documents to Existing Test Sets

You can incrementally add documents to a COMPLETED test set — useful for building up test sets over time as new documents are processed and human-reviewed.

1. Select a single COMPLETED test set in the table
2. Click **Add Documents** and choose a source:
   - **From Existing Files**: Select a bucket, enter a file pattern, and optionally filter by modification time
   - **From Upload**: Upload a zip file containing new documents and their baselines
3. The test set shows an "Updating..." status while files are being added
4. After completion, the file count is updated and a result message is displayed

**Key behaviors:**
- **Automatic baseline filtering** (Input Bucket): Files without matching baseline data in the evaluation bucket are automatically excluded rather than failing. A result message reports the counts (e.g., "Added 8 of 12 files (4 excluded - no baseline data)").
- **Idempotent**: Adding a document that already exists overwrites it. File counts are always recounted from S3 for accuracy.
- **Prepopulated file pattern**: The file pattern field is pre-filled with the pattern used to create the test set, so you can reuse or adjust it.
- **Time filter**: Use the "Modified after" filter — choose a preset (Last 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) or select "Custom date/time" with a date picker to specify an exact cutoff. This makes it easy to pick up recently reviewed documents without crafting complex patterns.

### File Structure Requirements
```
my-test-set/
├── input/
│   ├── document1.pdf
│   └── document2.pdf
└── baseline/
    ├── document1.pdf/
    │   └── [ground truth files]
    └── document2.pdf/
        └── [ground truth files]
```

### Validation Rules
- Each input file must have corresponding baseline folder
- Baseline folder name must match input filename exactly
- When using Input Bucket as source, files without baselines are automatically excluded (not treated as an error)
- Status: COMPLETED (valid), FAILED (validation errors), QUEUED/COPYING (creating), UPDATING (adding documents)

### Upload Methods
1. **UI Zip Upload**: S3 event → Lambda extraction → Validation → Status update
2. **Direct S3 Upload**: Detected via refresh button or automatic polling

## Test Executions

### Running Tests
1. Select test set from dropdown
2. **Optional**: Select configuration version to use for processing
3. **Optional**: Enter number of files to limit processing (useful for quick testing)
4. **Optional**: Add context description for the test run
5. Click "Run Test" (single test execution only)
6. Monitor progress via TestRunnerStatus
7. View results in integrated listing

### Configuration Versioning
The Test Studio supports running tests with specific configuration versions:
- **Version Selection**: Choose from available configuration versions (e.g., `default`, `Production`, `v1`)
- **Version Tracking**: Test results display which configuration version was used
- **Version Comparison**: Compare test runs across different configuration versions
- **Context Generation**: Test context automatically includes the selected version information

For full details on configuration versioning, see [configuration-versions.md](configuration-versions.md).

### Test States
- **QUEUED**: File copying jobs queued in SQS
- **RUNNING**: Files being copied and processed
- **COMPLETED**: Test finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Errors during processing

### Results Management
- Filter and paginate test runs
- Multi-select for comparison
- Navigate to detailed results view
- Delete and export functionality

## Key Features

### Test Set Management
- Reusable collections with file patterns across multiple buckets
- Dual bucket support (Input Bucket and Test Set Bucket)
- Optional description field for documenting test set purpose
- Zip upload with automatic extraction
- Direct upload detection via dual polling
- File structure validation with error reporting

### Test Execution
- Single test concurrency prevention
- Optional file count limiting for quick testing
- Real-time status monitoring
- Global state persistence across navigation
- SQS-based asynchronous processing

### Results Analysis
- Comprehensive metrics display including:
  - **Test run metadata**: Configuration version, duration, context, file counts
  - **Overall accuracy and confidence metrics**
  - **Cost metrics**: Total cost and average cost per page
  - **Accuracy breakdown** (precision, recall, F1-score, false alarm rate, false discovery rate)
  - **Field-Level Metrics**: Per-field extraction performance table with columns: Field Name, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, TP, FP, TN, FN
  - **Average Document Split Classification Metrics**:
    - Page Level Accuracy (average across documents)
    - Split Accuracy Without Order (average across documents)
    - Split Accuracy With Order (average across documents)  
    - Total Pages, Total Splits (sums across documents)
    - Correctly Classified Pages, Correctly Split counts (sums across documents)
  - **Cost breakdown** by service and context
- Side-by-side test comparison with all metrics including configuration versions
- Export capabilities (JSON/CSV downloads include all metrics)
- Integrated delete operations

### Bulk Aggregation with Stickler

Test Studio uses Stickler's `BulkStructuredModelEvaluator` for accurate metric aggregation across multiple documents:

**How It Works:**
1. **Individual Evaluation**: Each document is evaluated with `include_confusion_matrix=True` to capture detailed field-level metrics
2. **Storage**: Raw Stickler comparison results are stored in S3 at `{doc_path}/evaluation/results.json` under the `stickler_comparison_result` field
3. **Aggregation**: When viewing test results, the system:
   - Scans DynamoDB for all documents in the test run (PK pattern: `doc#{test_run_id}*`)
   - Loads evaluation results from S3
   - Extracts `stickler_comparison_result` from each document
   - Uses `aggregate_from_comparisons()` to compute aggregate metrics
4. **Fallback**: Athena-based aggregation remains available for backward compatibility with older data

**Benefits:**
- **More Accurate**: Uses Stickler's confusion matrix for precise field-level metrics
- **Consistent**: Same evaluation engine for single documents and bulk aggregation
- **Efficient**: No Athena queries needed for new data
- **Cost Effective**: Reduces Athena query costs

### Field-Level Metrics

Test results include detailed per-field extraction performance metrics displayed in an interactive table:

**Displayed Columns:**
1. **Field Name**: The name of the extracted field
2. **Accuracy**: `(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)` - Overall correctness
3. **Precision**: `TP / (TP + FP)` - Accuracy of positive predictions
4. **Recall**: `TP / (TP + FN)` - Coverage of actual positives
5. **TP** (True Positives): Correctly extracted values
6. **FP** (False Positives): Incorrectly extracted values
7. **TN** (True Negatives): Correctly identified as absent
8. **FN** (False Negatives): Missed extractions

**Features:**
- **Searchable**: Filter fields by name to quickly find specific metrics
- **Sortable**: Click any column header to sort by that metric
- **Expandable Section**: Collapsed by default to keep results view clean
- **Paginated**: 10 fields per page for easy navigation
- **Resizable Columns**: Adjust column widths as needed

**How It Works:**
- Backend stores confusion matrix values (TP, FP, TN, FN) from Stickler aggregation
- UI calculates Accuracy, Precision, and Recall on-the-fly from these values
- Metrics displayed with 3 decimal precision (e.g., 0.850)

**Use Cases:**
- Identify which fields have low extraction accuracy
- Compare field-level performance across test runs
- Prioritize prompt engineering efforts on problematic fields
- Track improvement in specific fields after configuration changes
