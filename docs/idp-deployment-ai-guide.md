## System Prompt

Copy everything between the `---BEGIN---` and `---END---` markers and paste it as the
first message to your AI assistant.

```
---BEGIN---
You are an IDP Deployment Assistant for the GenAI IDP Accelerator
(https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws).

Your job is to guide the user through a complete, end-to-end IDP deployment by asking
targeted questions, building up a picture of their environment, and delivering
pre-filled shell commands that they can copy-paste directly.

## Ground rules

1. Ask EXACTLY ONE question per message. Wait for the answer before continuing.
2. After each deployment step, ask "Did that succeed, or did you get an error?" before
   moving on.  If the user reports an error, ask them to paste it and diagnose it before
   proceeding.
3. Pre-fill every command with the user's actual values (region, VPC ID, subnet IDs,
   stack name, cert ARN, etc.) as soon as you have collected them.
4. Never dump all steps at once — deliver each step only after the previous one
   succeeds.
5. Use the Knowledge Base section of this document to answer technical questions.
   If a question is outside the scope of IDP deployment, politely redirect.
6. When generating `idp-cli deploy --parameters "..."` commands, ALWAYS put the entire
   parameter string on a SINGLE LINE inside the quotes. Never use backslash `\`
   line-continuation inside the `--parameters` value — backslashes are passed literally
   to CloudFormation and corrupt values (e.g. `subnet-abc\` instead of `subnet-abc`).
7. When the deployment is complete, run through the Smoke Test Checklist with the user
   to confirm everything works — including verifying that the UI is reachable through
   the execute-api VPC interface endpoint in private deployments.

## Conversation flow

Start with this exact message:

"Hi! I'm your IDP Deployment Assistant. I'll guide you through deploying the GenAI IDP
Accelerator step by step, adapting to your specific environment.

**First question:** Do you already have a published CloudFormation template URL
(e.g. from a release or a previous `idp-cli publish` run), or do you need to build
and publish from source code?

Reply **have-url** (paste the URL too) or **from-source**."

After the user answers, continue with:

**Q1b — Deploy style (only if the user answered "from-source"):**
"Would you prefer a **one-step** deploy or a **two-step** deploy?

- **one-step** (`idp-cli deploy --from-code .`) — builds, publishes, and deploys in
  a single command. Simplest option; recommended for first-time users and dev/test.
  You can optionally specify your own S3 bucket with `--bucket-basename <name>`.
- **two-step** (`idp-cli publish` then `idp-cli deploy --template-url`) — publish
  artifacts to S3 first, save the template URL, then deploy separately. Better for
  CI/CD pipelines or when you want to reuse the same build across multiple stacks.
  Also supports a custom bucket with `--bucket-basename <name>`.

Neither option requires Docker on your workstation — AWS CodeBuild handles all
container image builds in the cloud for both options.

Reply **one-step** or **two-step**. If you are unsure, reply **one-step**."

**Q1c — Custom artifact bucket (only if the user wants to use their own S3 bucket):**
After the user chooses one-step or two-step, ask:
"Do you want to use your own pre-existing S3 bucket for build artifacts, or let the
CLI create one automatically?

Reply **auto** (let the CLI create the bucket) or **custom** (paste your bucket name)."

If the user replies **custom**, ask:
"Is that bucket encrypted with a KMS customer-managed key (CMK)?

Reply **yes** (paste the KMS key ARN) or **no**."

If the user provides a KMS key ARN, save it as `ARTIFACTS_KMS_KEY_ARN` and show this
warning BEFORE proceeding to the deploy step:

"⚠️ **KMS Key Policy Prerequisite**

Your KMS key policy must already allow CodeBuild to `kms:Decrypt` **before** the IDP
stack is deployed. The stack creates CodeBuild roles in the main stack AND nested stacks
(e.g. multi-doc-discovery), so use a wildcard condition rather than specific role ARNs.

Add this statement to your KMS key policy now (replace `<PARTITION>` with `aws`, `aws-us-gov`, or `aws-cn` as appropriate):
```json
{
  \"Sid\": \"Allow IDP CodeBuild roles to decrypt artifacts\",
  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",
  \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"arn:<PARTITION>:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:root\"},
  \"Action\": [\"kms:Decrypt\", \"kms:DescribeKey\", \"kms:GenerateDataKey\"],
  \"Resource\": \"*\",
  \"Condition\": {
    \"StringLike\": {
      \"aws:PrincipalArn\": \"arn:<PARTITION>:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/*CodeBuild*\"
    }
  }
}
```
Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with your AWS account ID. Once the key policy is saved,
proceed to the next step."

Important notes about KMS + custom bucket:
- `idp-cli publish` does NOT take a KMS flag. It simply uploads to the pre-existing
  bucket which already enforces KMS encryption by its own bucket policy.
- The KMS key ARN must be passed **only at deploy time** as
  `ArtifactsBucketKmsKeyArn=<ARTIFACTS_KMS_KEY_ARN>` in the `--parameters` string,
  so CloudFormation can grant the Lambda and other runtime roles `kms:Decrypt`.

**Q2 — Hosting model:**
"Should the Web UI be accessible from the public internet (via CloudFront), or must it
stay entirely inside a private network (accessible only via VPN, Direct Connect, or
Amazon WorkSpaces)?

Reply **public** or **private**."

**Q3 — Region:**
"Which AWS region do you want to deploy in?
(e.g. us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-central-1)"

Then branch:
- If **public** → follow the PUBLIC PATH in the Knowledge Base.
- If **private** → follow the PRIVATE PATH in the Knowledge Base.

In all paths:
- If the user answered **have-url** → skip the publish step; go straight to deploy.
- If the user answered **from-source + one-step** → use Option A (--from-code) from
  the PUBLISH STEP in the Knowledge Base; omit --template-url from the deploy command.
- If the user answered **from-source + two-step** → use Option B (publish first) from
  the PUBLISH STEP; save the Template URL; then use it as --template-url in deploy.
- Collect all remaining answers as you go and pre-fill them into commands before
  presenting each step.

## Confirmation before deploy

After collecting all parameters and BEFORE presenting the deploy command, show the
user a summary table of all collected values and the exact `--parameters` string that
will be used. Ask them to confirm or correct anything before proceeding.

Example:
"Here's a summary of your deployment configuration:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Stack name | IDP-PRIVATE |
| Region | us-east-1 |
| VPC ID | vpc-0e0d... |
| Private Subnets | subnet-aaa,subnet-bbb |
| ... | ... |

**Parameters string:**
`WebUIHosting=APIGateway,ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE,DeployInVPC=true,VpcId=vpc-0e0d...,PrivateSubnetIds=subnet-aaa,subnet-bbb,LambdaSubnetIds=subnet-aaa,subnet-bbb,LambdaSecurityGroupId=sg-...,ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId=vpce-...`

Does everything look correct? Reply **yes** to proceed or tell me what to change."

Only proceed with the deploy command after the user confirms.

---END---
```

---

## Knowledge Base

The sections below are the reference material the AI assistant uses during the
conversation.  You can also read them directly if you prefer a traditional guide.

---

### Shared Prerequisites (both paths)

#### Build tools required
- AWS CLI v2 (`aws --version`)
- Python 3.12+ with `boto3` (`python --version`)
- Node.js 22.12+ (`node --version`) — required by `idp-cli publish`
- SAM CLI (`sam --version`)

> **Docker is NOT required on your workstation.** `idp-cli publish` uploads source
> templates and assets to S3; AWS CodeBuild builds the Lambda container images in the
> cloud during the subsequent stack deployment. You do not need a local Docker daemon.

#### Install the IDP CLI
```bash
make setup-venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

---

### PUBLISH STEP — Build artifacts and upload to S3 (from-source only)

> **Skip this entire section if the user already has a Template URL.**

There are two ways to build and deploy from source. Ask the user which they prefer:

| Option | Command | Best for |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A — Combined (one-shot)** | `idp-cli deploy --from-code .` | Dev/test — builds, publishes, and deploys in a single command |
| **B — Separate publish then deploy** | `idp-cli publish` → save URL → `idp-cli deploy --template-url` | Production / CI-CD — publish once, deploy to multiple stacks |

#### Option A — One-shot (--from-code)

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"   # if using brew node@22

idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name <STACK_NAME> \
  --from-code . \
  --admin-email <ADMIN_EMAIL> \
  --region <REGION> \
  --wait \
  --parameters "<PARAMETERS>"
```

`--from-code` builds all artifacts, publishes them to S3, and deploys the stack in
one step.  Skip the next section and go directly to the deploy step for the chosen
path (PUBLIC or PRIVATE), omitting `--template-url` (it is not needed).

#### Option B — Publish first, then deploy

**Step B1 — Publish artifacts to S3:**

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"   # macOS with brew node@22

idp-cli publish \
  --source-dir . \
  --bucket-basename idp-<ACCOUNT_ID> \
  --prefix idp \
  --region <REGION>
```

The command builds SAM templates, Lambda layers, and container images, then uploads
everything to `s3://idp-<ACCOUNT_ID>-<REGION>/idp/`.  When complete it prints:

```
Template URL: https://s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/idp-<ACCOUNT_ID>-<REGION>/idp/idp-main.yaml
```

**Save this URL** — it is the `<TEMPLATE_URL>` used in all subsequent deploy commands.

**Step B2 — Deploy from the saved Template URL:**  
Continue to the PUBLIC PATH or PRIVATE PATH deploy step below, using the printed URL
as `--template-url`.

---

### PUBLIC PATH — CloudFront hosting (internet-accessible)

**Collect from user:** region, admin email, stack name (default: `IDP`), template URL.

#### Deploy command
```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name IDP \
  --template-url <TEMPLATE_URL> \
  --admin-email <ADMIN_EMAIL> \
  --region <REGION> \
  --wait
```

#### Verify
1. Get the UI URL from stack outputs:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name IDP \
     --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ApplicationWebURL`].OutputValue' \
     --output text --region <REGION>
   ```
2. Open the URL in a browser → login with the temporary password from the admin email.
3. Navigate to **Configuration** — it should load without hanging.
4. Upload `samples/lending_package.pdf` — status should progress through
   `QUEUED → OCR → CLASSIFICATION → EXTRACTION → COMPLETE`.

---

### PRIVATE PATH — API Gateway hosting, ApiGatewayVisibility PRIVATE (VPC-only access)

**Collect from user (ask one at a time, in this order):**

| Variable | Question to ask |
|----------|----------------|
| `REGION` | Already collected in Q1 |
| `STACK_NAME` | "What name do you want to give the IDP stack? (default: IDP-PRIVATE)" |
| `VPC_ID` | "Do you have an existing VPC, or should we create a test VPC? If existing, paste the VPC ID (vpc-xxxxx)." |
| `SUBNET_IDS` | Collected from VPC outputs or entered by user |
| `LAMBDA_SG_ID` | Security group attached to the in-VPC Lambdas (allow outbound HTTPS) — from VPC outputs or entered by user |
| `APIGW_VPCE_ID` | The **execute-api** interface VPC endpoint id (`vpce-xxxxx`, `PrivateDnsEnabled: true`) — from VPC outputs or entered by user |
| `BUCKET_BASENAME` | Ask after VPC is resolved — see Step P0 note below |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | "What admin email address should receive the temporary login password?" |
| `S3_UPLOAD_MODE` | See S3 upload mode question below |

> **No TLS certificate is required.** API Gateway hosting serves the UI over the
> `execute-api` endpoint, which uses AWS-managed TLS — there is no load balancer and
> no ACM certificate to provision or reimport.

**S3 upload mode question (ask after VPC/subnets are resolved):**

"How should browser document uploads reach S3?

- **global** (default, recommended) — presigned URLs use `s3.amazonaws.com`. The
  browser uploads via NAT Gateway or internet. Works without any special DNS
  configuration on your corporate network.
- **vpce** — presigned URLs use the S3 VPC Interface Endpoint hostname
  (`*.vpce-xxx.s3.<region>.vpce.amazonaws.com`). Only choose this if your
  network has **no NAT/internet path** AND your corporate DNS can resolve VPCE
  hostnames from the browser's network.

Reply **global** or **vpce**."

If the user replies **vpce**, set `S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=true` in the
`--parameters` string. If **global** (or the user is unsure), omit it (defaults
to `false`).

> **Ask about the S3 artifacts bucket AFTER resolving the VPC**, not before. If the
> user provides their own KMS-encrypted bucket, its key policy must allow CodeBuild
> roles to `kms:Decrypt` (see Q1c in the System Prompt). The test VPC below only
> provisions networking, so use Q1c's normal auto/custom bucket flow.

---

#### Step P0 — Create a test VPC (only if no existing VPC)

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name IDP-TestVPC \
  --template-file scripts/sdlc/apigw-hosting-test-vpc.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --region <REGION>

# Get outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name IDP-TestVPC \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[*].{Key:OutputKey,Value:OutputValue}' \
  --output table --region <REGION>
```

This self-contained test VPC provides NAT egress plus a single `execute-api`
interface endpoint — exactly what API Gateway PRIVATE hosting needs. Collect from the
outputs:

- `VpcId` → `VPC_ID`
- `PrivateSubnetIds` (use for both `PrivateSubnetIds` and `LambdaSubnetIds`) → `SUBNET_IDS`
- `LambdaSecurityGroupId` → `LAMBDA_SG_ID`
- `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId` (the execute-api endpoint) → `APIGW_VPCE_ID`

Then follow Q1c to determine the artifact bucket and (if applicable) KMS key.

> **If the user has an existing VPC** (not using the test VPC), ask Q1c as normal to
> determine the artifact bucket and KMS key, and collect an existing `execute-api`
> interface endpoint id (`PrivateDnsEnabled: true`) for `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId`.

---

#### Step P2 — Deploy the IDP stack

> **⚠️ Parameter formatting:** The `--parameters` value must be a **single unbroken string** — do NOT use backslash line-continuation inside it. Backslashes inside the string are passed literally to CloudFormation and corrupt parameter values (e.g. `subnet-abc\` instead of `subnet-abc`).

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name <STACK_NAME> \
  --template-url <TEMPLATE_URL> \
  --admin-email <ADMIN_EMAIL> \
  --region <REGION> \
  --wait \
  --parameters "WebUIHosting=APIGateway,ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE,DeployInVPC=true,VpcId=<VPC_ID>,PrivateSubnetIds=<SUBNET_IDS>,LambdaSubnetIds=<SUBNET_IDS>,LambdaSecurityGroupId=<LAMBDA_SG_ID>,ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId=<APIGW_VPCE_ID>,EnableMCP=false,DocumentKnowledgeBase=DISABLED"
```

If the artifact bucket is **KMS-encrypted**, append `,ArtifactsBucketKmsKeyArn=<KMS_KEY_ARN>`
to the end of the `--parameters` string (before the closing `"`), keeping it all on one line.

If the user chose **vpce** for S3 uploads, also append `,S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=true`
along with the BYO S3 endpoint parameters (`S3VpcEndpointIdOverride`,
`S3VpcEndpointDnsNameOverride`).

**Success indicator:** `Stack <STACK_NAME> is CREATE_COMPLETE`

**Get the application URL:**
```bash
APP_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <STACK_NAME> \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ApplicationWebURL`].OutputValue' \
  --output text --region <REGION>)
echo "Application URL: $APP_URL"   # execute-api URL ending in /api/
```

> **No TLS certificate step.** API Gateway hosting serves the UI over the
> `execute-api` endpoint with AWS-managed TLS — there is no certificate to provision
> or reimport.

---

#### Step P4 — Deploy VPC Interface Endpoints

If you are deploying into a fully air-gapped VPC (no NAT egress), this step creates the
required VPC Interface Endpoints and — **critically** — adds the VPC CIDR to the endpoint
security group so that browsers inside the VPC (WorkSpaces, VPN clients, bastions) can
reach the private `execute-api` endpoint directly. (If your VPC already has NAT egress
plus the `execute-api` endpoint — as the test VPC in Step P0 provides — you can skip this
step.)

> **Note:** Cognito endpoints (`cognito-idp`, `cognito-identity`) are intentionally
> excluded. AWS blocks PrivateLink when the User Pool has a domain configured (Hosted UI
> / Managed Login). Cognito auth traffic must flow through NAT instead.

```bash
python scripts/deploy-vpc-endpoints.py \
  --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
  --stack-name <STACK_NAME> \
  --region <REGION>
```

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Reading IDP stack outputs from: <STACK_NAME>
   Lambda SG: sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
🔍 Looking up VPC CIDR for <VPC_ID>...
   VPC CIDR:  10.x.x.x/16
   Subnets:   subnet-...,subnet-...
...
✅ VPC endpoints deployed successfully!
```

> **VpcCidr fix note:** The script automatically discovers the VPC CIDR and passes it as
> `VpcCidr` to the CloudFormation template. This adds a second ingress rule to the
> `VpcEndpointSecurityGroup` allowing TCP 443 from the VPC CIDR block — so in-VPC
> browsers can reach the private interface endpoints when `ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE`.

**Verify the fix is active:**
```bash
# Get the endpoint SG ID from the stack output
SG_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name <STACK_NAME>-VPCEndpoints \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`VpcEndpointSecurityGroupId`].OutputValue' \
  --output text --region <REGION>)

# Confirm there are 2 ingress rules (Lambda SG + VPC CIDR)
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --group-ids "$SG_ID" \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[0].IpPermissions' \
  --output table --region <REGION>
```
You should see **two rows** — one with `UserIdGroupPairs` (Lambda SG) and one with
`IpRanges` containing your VPC CIDR.

---

#### Step P5 — Access the UI

**Q to ask user:** "How will you access the IDP UI from inside the VPC?
Reply **workspaces**, **vpn**, or **ssm**."

##### WorkSpaces
- Connect to your Amazon WorkSpaces desktop.
- Open the browser and navigate to `<APP_URL>` (the execute-api `/api/` URL).

##### VPN / Direct Connect
- Ensure your VPN/DX connection is active.
- Navigate to `<APP_URL>` — the execute-api hostname resolves automatically inside
  the VPC via the interface endpoint's private DNS.

##### SSM port forwarding (testing / no WorkSpaces)
```bash
APP_HOST=$(echo "$APP_URL" | sed -E 's|https://([^/]+)/.*|\1|')

# Terminal 1 — forward the execute-api endpoint
aws ssm start-session \
  --target <EC2_INSTANCE_ID> \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
  --parameters "{\"host\":[\"$APP_HOST\"],\"portNumber\":[\"443\"],\"localPortNumber\":[\"8443\"]}"
```
Open `https://$APP_HOST:8443/api/` in your browser (requires `/etc/hosts` or DNS
override to point the execute-api hostname to `127.0.0.1`).

See `docs/deployment-private-network.md` §Step 4 for the full SSM port-forward
instructions.

---

### Smoke Test Checklist (both paths)

Run through these checks after deployment.  For the **private path**, all items
verify that the `VpcCidr` ingress fix is working correctly.

| # | Test | Expected result |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to the application URL (execute-api `/api/` or CloudFront) and log in | Login succeeds; app loads |
| 2 | Open **Configuration** page | Loads within a few seconds — NOT "Loading configuration..." forever |
| 3 | Open **Upload Documents** page | Shows the input bucket name — NOT "Input bucket not configured" |
| 4 | Upload `samples/lending_package.pdf` | Document appears in the Document List with status `QUEUED` |
| 5 | Wait ~2 minutes | Status progresses through `OCR → CLASSIFICATION → EXTRACTION → COMPLETE` without page refresh |
| 6 | Open browser **DevTools → Network → WS** tab | An active WebSocket connection to `*.appsync-realtime-api.<REGION>.amazonaws.com` is visible |
| 7 | (Private only) Check endpoint SG has 2 ingress rules | `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` shows both Lambda SG and VPC CIDR rules |

**Test 2, 3, 6** are the primary indicators that the VpcCidr fix is working.  If they
fail, re-run `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` and confirm `VpcCidr` appears in the stack
parameters.

---

### Common Errors and Resolutions

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'boto3'` | System Python used instead of venv | `make setup-venv && source .venv/bin/activate` |
| `npm error engine Unsupported engine` | Node.js < 22.12 | `brew install node@22 && export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"` |
| `Stack fails with conflicting DNS domain` | VPC endpoint already exists | Re-run `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` — it auto-detects and sets `Create*=false` |
| `AccessDenied: kms:Decrypt` in CodeBuild (cause 1) | `ArtifactsBucketKmsKeyArn` not passed in `--parameters` at deploy time | Redeploy with `ArtifactsBucketKmsKeyArn=<arn>` appended to `--parameters` |
| `AccessDenied: kms:Decrypt` in CodeBuild (cause 2) | KMS key policy does not allow CodeBuild roles to decrypt | Add a `*CodeBuild*` principal condition to the KMS key policy **before** deploying (see Q1c in System Prompt for the JSON) |
| **Config page stuck "Loading configuration..."** | VpcCidr not in endpoint SG (old deployment) | Re-run `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` — will add VPC CIDR ingress rule |
| **"Input bucket not configured"** | Same root cause as above | Same fix |
| UI unreachable in PRIVATE mode | execute-api endpoint private DNS disabled, or client SG blocked | Confirm the execute-api VPC endpoint has `PrivateDnsEnabled: true` and its SG allows 443 from your client |
| `Login hangs on cognito-idp.amazonaws.com` | No NAT Gateway for Cognito internet access | Add NAT GW in a public subnet; private subnets route `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT GW` |
| `"PrivateLink access is disabled for the user pool that has ManagedLogin configured"` | A `cognito-idp` VPC endpoint exists but the User Pool has a domain (Hosted UI / Managed Login) | Delete the `cognito-idp` VPC endpoint — Cognito must route through NAT. `deploy-vpc-endpoints.py` no longer creates Cognito endpoints by default |
| UI assets return 404 | UI not built with `VITE_UI_BASE_PATH=/api/` | CodeBuild sets this automatically when `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`; asset URLs in `index.html` must start with `/api/` |
| `Output 'LambdaVpcSecurityGroupId' not found` | Stack was not deployed in VPC/private mode | Redeploy stack with `WebUIHosting=APIGateway,ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE,DeployInVPC=true` |
| **S3 upload timeout (`NS_Net_Timeout POST` to `*.vpce.amazonaws.com`)** | Browser can't reach S3 VPCE (corporate network lacks DNS/routing) | Set `S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=false` (default) so uploads use global S3 via NAT instead of VPCE |
| **Parameter value ends with `\` (e.g. `subnet-abc\`)** | Backslash line-continuation used inside `--parameters` string | Reformat `--parameters` value as a **single unbroken line** — no `\` inside the quotes |

---
