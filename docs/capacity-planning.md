**This feature is designed for Pattern 2 and the Unified pattern** due to their well-defined processing steps (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization) and predictable Bedrock model quota requirements. The Unified pattern uses the same Bedrock pipeline as Pattern 2 for capacity planning purposes.

## Key Benefits

- **Predictive Analysis**: Calculate processing capacity requirements before scaling production workloads
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-size AWS resources based on actual processing patterns
- **Performance Planning**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize processing pipelines
- **Quota Management**: Automatically calculate required AWS service quotas (TPM and RPM)
- **Load Distribution**: Plan processing schedules to maximize throughput
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track capacity utilization and adjust dynamically

## Architecture Overview

The capacity planning system consists of several integrated components that work together to provide comprehensive capacity analysis:

## Using the Capacity Planning System

### 1. Accessing the Capacity Planner

**⚠️ Pattern 2 or Unified Only**: This feature is available for Pattern 2 and Unified pattern deployments. The navigation link will not appear for Pattern 1 or Pattern 3.

Navigate to the Web UI and select the "Capacity Planning" section:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Must be using Pattern 2 or Unified pattern** (Textract + Bedrock pipeline)
   - Process some documents first to populate metering data
   - Documents must be single-class and classified with configured document types
2. **Configuration**: Visit "View/Edit Configuration" tab to load your pattern configuration
3. **Navigation**: Click on "Capacity Planning" in the main navigation (visible for Pattern 2 and Unified)
4. **Pattern Detection**: System automatically detects your deployment pattern. The Unified pattern is treated as Pattern 2 for capacity planning purposes

### 2. Document Configuration

**Step 1: Document Type Setup**
- Select document types **only from classes configured in View/Edit Configuration**
- Use "Populate tokens from Documents" to automatically extract token usage from processed documents
- Average pages per document is automatically extracted from metering data
- Set token usage for each processing step (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization)

**Step 2: Token Population from Processed Documents**
```javascript
// Example of automatic token and page extraction from metering data
{
  "OCR/bedrock/us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0": {
    "totalTokens": 1500,
    "requests": 3,  // Used as page count
    "pages": 3
  },
  "Classification/bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-haiku": {
    "inputTokens": 800,
    "outputTokens": 200,
    "requests": 1
  },
  "Extraction/bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-haiku": {
    "inputTokens": 2000,
    "outputTokens": 500,
    "requests": 2
  }
}
```

**Page Count Extraction Priority**:
1. OCR Bedrock requests count (`metrics.requests`)
2. BDA pattern pages (`BDAProject/bda/*.pages`)
3. Metering fields (`pages`, `pageCount`, `PageCount`)
4. Document-level fields (`doc.PageCount`, `doc.pageCount`, `doc.Pages`)
5. Sections EndPage field as fallback

**Step 3: CSV Import/Export**
- Import document configurations from CSV files
- Export current configurations for backup or sharing
- Validation for required OCR tokens when Bedrock OCR is configured

### 3. Processing Schedule Configuration

**Hourly Processing Schedule**:
- Configure processing volumes by hour using 24-hour time slots
- Select document types **only from types configured in Document Processing section**
- Specify documents per hour for each time slot and document type
- Visual time slot selection with hour range display (e.g., "09:00 - 10:00")

**Maximum Latency Configuration**:
- Enter maximum allowed latency in **seconds** (1-3600 seconds)
- Quick reference: 60s = 1 min | 120s = 2 min | 300s = 5 min | 600s = 10 min
- Used for SLA compliance checking and performance validation
- Displayed with automatic conversion to minutes for reference

### 4. Capacity Calculation and Results

**Running Capacity Analysis**:
- Click "Calculate Capacity Requirements" to perform analysis
- System validates configuration and processes requirements
- **Real processing times** are extracted from actual processed documents
- **Real queue delays** are calculated from QueuedTime/WorkflowStartTime timestamps

**Capacity Metrics Display**:
- **Total Docs**: Aggregate documents per hour across all time slots
- **Total Pages**: Calculated from document volumes and average pages
- **Total Tokens**: Aggregated token usage across all processing steps (displayed in millions)

**Latency Distribution Analysis**:
- Processing time percentiles (P50, P75, P90, P95, P99) from **real document data**
- Base processing time: Median processing time from actual documents
- Queue delay: Actual queue delays from QueuedTime/WorkflowStartTime timestamps
- **Quota Status**: Shows "✅ Within Quota" or "⚠️ Quota Exceeded" based on all model quotas
- **SLA Target**: Configured maximum latency in seconds

**Latency Bar Colors**:
- **Green/Blue**: When all model quotas are within limits (regardless of SLA)
- **Red**: Only when any model quota shows "Increase Needed"

### 5. AWS Service Quota Management

**Quota Requirements Analysis**:
- **Bedrock Models TPM**: Tokens Per Minute requirements by model and processing step
- **Bedrock Models RPM**: Requests Per Minute requirements by model and processing step
- Current vs. required quota comparison with utilization percentages
- Status indicators: ✅ Sufficient, ⚠️ Increase Needed

**RPM Calculation Method**:
```
1. Sample up to 100 documents with metering data
2. Calculate average requests per document for each processing step
3. Multiply by scheduled documents per hour
4. Apply 10% safety buffer for burst traffic
5. Convert to per-minute rate

Formula: peak_rpm = (avg_requests_per_doc × scheduled_docs_per_hour / 60) × 1.1

Where:
- avg_requests_per_doc: Calculated from metering samples
- scheduled_docs_per_hour: Sum across all hourly time slots
- 1.1 = 10% safety buffer (not SLA factor)
```

**Direct AWS Console Integration**:
- "Request Increase" buttons that open AWS Service Quotas console
- Region-specific console URLs using configured AWS region
- Direct links to specific model quotas when `VITE_BEDROCK_MODEL_QUOTA_CODES` is configured
- Fallback to generic Bedrock quotas page when configuration is missing

**OCR Quota Handling**:
- OCR quota requirements are **automatically skipped** when OCR tokens are 0 (OCR not in use)
- This prevents errors when using Textract OCR instead of Bedrock OCR

### 6. Safety Buffer and Quota Calculation Details

**10% Safety Buffer**:

All TPM and RPM quota calculations include a **10% safety buffer** (multiplier of 1.1) to ensure adequate capacity. This buffer accounts for:
- **Burst traffic**: Documents arriving faster than scheduled averages
- **Token count variations**: Actual token usage may vary per document
- **Request count variations**: Some documents may require more API requests
- **System overhead**: Retries, error handling, and processing variations

**TPM (Tokens Per Minute) Calculation**:
```
Formula: peak_tpm = max(tokens_per_hour_for_each_hour / 60) × 1.1

Where:
- tokens_per_hour = Σ(scheduled_docs × tokens_per_doc)
- max() = peak across all 24 hours (not average)
- 1.1 = 10% safety buffer
- Each processing step calculated separately
```

**Example**:
```
Hour 9:  100 invoices × 5,000 extraction tokens = 500,000 tokens/hour
         500,000 / 60 = 8,333 tokens/minute
         8,333 × 1.1 = 9,166 TPM required for extraction
```

**Why Peak Hour (not Average)**:
- AWS Bedrock quotas are enforced per minute
- System must handle peak demand to avoid throttling
- Average load calculations would underestimate requirements

**Understanding Overload States**:

When scheduled demand exceeds quota capacity, the system reports:
- **Historical queue delays**: Actual delays from processed documents
- **Overload warning**: Indicates demand > capacity
- **Action required**: Increase quotas or reduce scheduled volume

**Important**: The system does NOT predict future queue delays during overload because they depend on:
- How long the overload persists
- Whether quota increases are approved
- Changes to the processing schedule
- System backlog at overload start

If overload persists, queue will grow indefinitely until quotas are increased or demand is reduced.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Token Usage Analysis and Visualization

**Hourly Token Distribution Chart**:
- Interactive stacked bar chart showing token usage by hour

### 2. Real Data Requirements

**No Estimation Mode**:
The capacity planning system requires **real processed documents** with metering data. It does not estimate or use default values for:
- Processing times (requires `/lambda/duration` gb_seconds or WorkflowStartTime/CompletionTime timestamps)
- Queue delays (requires QueuedTime/WorkflowStartTime timestamps)
- Request counts (requires metering data with requests field)
- Page counts (requires metering or document-level page data)

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Configuration Not Loaded**:
- **Symptom**: Warning message "Configuration not loaded"
- **Solution**: Visit "View/Edit Configuration" tab first to load pattern configuration

**No Documents Available for Token Population**:
- **Symptom**: Alert "No documents available. Please visit the Documents tab first"
- **Solution**: Visit Documents tab to load document data, then return to Capacity Planning

**Document Type Not in Configuration**:
- **Symptom**: "Document type 'X' is not defined in configuration"
- **Solution**: Add the document type to View/Edit Configuration, or use a document with a configured type

**Multi-Class Document Rejected**:
- **Symptom**: "Document has multiple classes. Capacity planning only supports single-class documents"
- **Solution**: Use single-class documents for capacity planning

**No Request Count Data Found**:
- **Symptom**: "No request count data found for [step_name]"
- **Solution**: Process documents through the full workflow to generate metering data with request counts

**No Processing Time Data**:
- **Symptom**: "No processing time data found in documents"
- **Solution**: Ensure documents have `/lambda/duration` gb_seconds or WorkflowStartTime/CompletionTime timestamps

**OCR Quota Error When Not Using Bedrock OCR**:
- **Symptom**: Error about missing OCR metering data
- **Solution**: This is fixed - OCR requirements are now skipped when OCR tokens are 0

### Best Practices

**Capacity Planning Workflow**:
1. **Process Sample Documents**: Run real documents through the full workflow first
2. **Load Configuration**: Visit View/Edit Configuration to load pattern settings
3. **Populate from Documents**: Use "Populate tokens from Documents" for accurate data
4. **Configure Schedule**: Define realistic processing schedules
5. **Calculate**: Run capacity calculations to identify quota requirements
6. **Request Quota Increases**: Use direct AWS console links to request needed quotas

**Token Usage Management**:
- Always use actual processed documents for token population
- Validate that document types match View/Edit Configuration classes
- Use single-class documents for accurate per-type analysis
- Export configurations as CSV for backup

**Quota Management**:
- Request quota increases proactively based on capacity analysis
- Check both TPM and RPM quotas - both can be limiting factors
- Monitor utilization percentages to avoid service limits
- The Lambda requires `BEDROCK_MODEL_QUOTA_CODES` and `BEDROCK_MODEL_RPM_QUOTA_CODES` to be configured

**Performance Optimization**:
- Analyze peak hour token distribution to optimize schedules
- Monitor latency distribution percentiles against SLA requirements
- Use the "Quota Status" indicator to quickly assess if quotas are sufficient
