# Plan: Retire granular assessment safely (+ unify extraction/confidence docs)

**Author:** design, 2026-07-03
**Status:** PROPOSAL → implement in sequenced PRs (do NOT reorder).
**Owner note:** this is a *major* update. The hard constraint: **no silent quality
regression for customers on non-agentic (simple) + separate confidence + granular
who process long documents / large lists.**

## Problem & evidence (from this session)
- The **large-list batching + reconcile** logic lives ONLY in the agentic/in-shard
  path (`extraction/service.py::_assess_results_batched` + `_reconcile_assessment_to_data`).
- The **standalone Assessment step** (non-agentic) calls
  `AssessmentService.assess_results` = **one single inference over the whole
  document's values** (`assessment/service.py:1110`). No list batching.
- **Granular assessment is currently the ONLY mechanism** that sub-divides large-list
  assessment for the non-agentic path (its README states it exists for "documents
  with hundreds of transactions"). So deleting granular naively regresses exactly
  those customers to the under-enumeration failure ("only 44 of 120 rows scored").
- Granular is also expensive + broken caching: its `<<CACHEPOINT>>` doesn't help
  (per-task content pollutes the cacheable prefix; 20-way ThreadPool causes a
  cacheWrite storm — measured ~1:1 write:read). A/B (RealKIE, 20 docs) showed
  **granular OFF = −74% cost ($0.354→$0.092/doc), equal accuracy/coverage, BETTER
  calibration (−0.026 → +0.024)**. See `scratch/ab5/OPTION-A-RESULT.md`.

**Conclusion:** granular should go, but only AFTER the standalone path can batch
large lists on its own. Then deletion is a strict improvement.

## Sequenced PRs (order is load-bearing)

### PR-G1 — Port batched assessment into the standalone path (the safety net)
Wire `AssessmentService.process_document_section` (non-agentic standalone step) to
use the SAME batching + per-column reconcile the agentic path already uses, instead
of the single `assess_results` call:
- Slice large list fields by `extraction.confidence.list_batch_size` (default 25),
  assess each batch with the shared scalars/context, concatenate in order — reuse
  the proven `_assess_results_batched` logic (factor it into a shared location both
  services import; today it's a method on ExtractionService — move to a shared
  helper module, e.g. `assessment/batching.py`, or `assessment/service.py`).
- Apply `_reconcile_assessment_to_data` (index-align, pad/truncate, per-column
  expansion — the fix from #416) so every list cell gets confidence + geometry.
- **Concurrency:** sequential or a SMALL bounded pool (e.g. 2–4), NOT granular's
  20-way ThreadPool. The cost win comes from avoiding the cacheWrite storm; do not
  reintroduce it. (If prompt caching is added later, add ONE cache-warm call before
  any fan-out — see the granular cachepoint post-mortem.)
- Non-agentic + separate + large doc now works WITHOUT granular.
- **Validate:** e2e on a genuinely large-list doc (bank-statement-multipage.pdf,
  ~120 rows) in simple+separate with granular OFF → all rows get confidence +
  geometry, row coverage matches extracted count, cost in the ~$0.09/doc range.
- Tests: unit test that the standalone path batches a >list_batch_size list and
  reconciles to full per-cell coverage.

### PR-G2 — Default `granular.enabled: false`; migration no-op
- Flip the system-defaults `extraction.confidence.granular.enabled` default → false.
- Update any config_library presets that pin `granular.enabled: true`.
- Migration: `granular.*` in an existing config still VALIDATES (v0.6 migration
  already tolerates it) but is IGNORED at runtime. No customer config edit required.
- On read, log a one-line deprecation note when a config still sets granular.enabled
  true ("granular assessment is retired; large lists are batched by the standalone
  assessment via confidence.list_batch_size").
- **Validate:** the PR-G1 large-doc e2e now runs by DEFAULT (granular off) with full
  coverage.

### PR-G3 — Delete granular_service + slim the assessment path (was PR-C)
- Remove `lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/assessment/granular_service.py`,
  `README_GRANULAR.md`, `example_usage.py` granular refs, the GranularAssessmentService
  import/branch in `assessment_function/index.py`, and the `granular` sub-config from
  `GranularAssessmentConfig`/`ConfidenceConfig` models + migration mapping + tests.
- Keep `list_batch_size` (now the single knob) and the batched standalone path.
- **Validate:** unit suite green (granular tests removed cleanly); large-doc e2e
  unchanged; full 5-mode A/B unchanged vs post-PR-G1 numbers.

### PR-G4 — Docs: unify extraction + confidence guide + migration guide
- **Merge** `docs/extraction.md` + `docs/assessment.md` (+ fold in
  `assessment-bounding-boxes.md` as the geometry section) into a single
  **"Extraction & Confidence"** guide reflecting v0.6 (confidence/geometry are
  outputs of extraction, not a separate stage). Present: Simple vs Advanced,
  Confidence off/separate/integrated, Geometry modes, HITL, large-doc guidance.
  Leave stub/redirects at the old paths for existing links.
- **Migration guide** (v0.5→v0.6, or a new v0.6→v0.7 entry): document the granular
  retirement, that `granular.*` is now a no-op, `list_batch_size` is the knob, and
  **mode guidance for large documents**: recommend Advanced (agentic) for large
  docs / big tables (shards extraction AND assessment; best-calibrated per A/B);
  simple+separate still handles large lists via batching but a very large single
  section is better served by Advanced sharding.
- Both doc tiers (docs/*.md + module README) + CHANGELOG.

## Migration handling for customers (the answer to "will this break them?")
- **No config breakage:** granular keys still validate; they're just ignored.
- **No quality regression:** PR-G1 lands the batching safety net BEFORE deletion, so
  non-agentic large-list assessment keeps working (better + cheaper).
- **Guidance, not silent change:** docs recommend Advanced mode for large/complex
  docs, but simple+separate remains viable — we do NOT force a mode change.
- **Deprecation signal:** one-line log when granular.enabled is still set true.

## Guardrails / constraints
- Order: G1 (safety net + large-doc e2e) → G2 (default off) → G3 (delete) → G4 (docs).
  NEVER delete before G1 is validated on a large-list document.
- AWS_PROFILE=default, us-west-2, IDPAgentic; never clobber Config#default; push to
  `github`; PRs → develop; gates (ruff, typecheck-pr, unit, UI build) green per PR;
  CHANGELOG + both doc tiers.
- Reuse the `ab5-*` configs + `scratch/ab5/analyze5.py` for re-validation; the
  large-list e2e target is bank-statement-multipage.pdf (has ~120-row table).

## Open decision for the owner
- Combine the guides now (recommended) vs keep separate: RECOMMEND combine in PR-G4.
- v0.7 config bump when granular is deleted? Suggest yes (granular removal is a
  format-relevant change), stamped via the existing config_format_version mechanism +
  a v06→v07 migration that drops `granular` (idempotent).
