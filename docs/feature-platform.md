# Feature Platform

> **Status: preview.** The Feature Platform is the *framework* for installable
> extensions; it is still being built out. Today it ships with a single bundled
> demo extension so you can see the mechanism end-to-end — more open-source
> extensions will follow. **AWS Marketplace–delivered (paid) extensions are a
> future capability: the framework supports them, but none exist yet.**
>
> The platform is **on by default** (`EnableFeaturePlatform=true`) in
> **auto-subscribe** mode — every catalog extension is installable directly,
> with no entitlement checks (the only mode exercised today). The
> Marketplace/entitlement path (`FeaturePlatformSimulatorEndpoint`,
> Subscribe → Active flow) is wired but unused until paid extensions ship. Set
> `EnableFeaturePlatform=false` to remove the platform entirely.

The Feature Platform turns the IDP Accelerator main stack into a **host** for
*installable extensions* — add-ons that are discovered and installed at runtime
without rebuilding the host. It is designed to grow into a catalog of
extensions over time.

A "feature" is an independent CloudFormation stack that an admin launches into
the **same AWS account** as the main IDP stack. Once the feature stack creates,
a custom resource uploads the feature's UI bundle into the main stack's
`WebUIBucket` and registers itself in the `InstalledFeatures` DynamoDB table.
From that moment on the feature appears as a new nav item inside the existing
IDP web UI, with its own page backed by a UMD-loaded React bundle.

## Deployment modes

| `FeaturePlatformSimulatorEndpoint` | `EnableFeaturePlatform` | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| (n/a) | `false` | Platform off — no platform resources are created. |
| `''` (default) | `true` (default) | **Auto-subscribe** — extensions in the catalog are installable directly; the UI goes straight to the Install prompt. No entitlement calls. The only mode used today. |
| `https://…` | `true` | **Marketplace** *(future)* — `checkFeatureEntitlement` calls the supplied simulator or real AWS Marketplace endpoint for entitlement state. Unused until paid extensions ship. |

The marketplace simulator is **not** bundled with the open-source
distribution. It is shipped separately and can be bolted onto a running stack
with no rebuild: deploy the standalone simulator, then set
`FeaturePlatformSimulatorEndpoint` on the main stack to its URL. Clearing the
parameter reverts to auto-subscribe.

## Two kinds of extensions

| | **OSS extension** | **Marketplace extension** *(future)* |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | `oss` | `marketplace` |
| Status | available today | framework only — none exist yet |
| Example | `docs-by-status`, `sample-health-insurance-review` (the bundled samples) | — |
| Where the template lives | the stack-owned **FeatureBucket** (copied from the artifacts bucket at deploy time) | a **private seller bucket** (GetObject-only, no public read) |
| Subscribe step | none — installable directly | UI links to the AWS Marketplace listing; buyer subscribes there |
| How `getFeatureLaunchUrl` produces the template URL | public S3 HTTPS URL of the FeatureBucket object | **presigned** GetObject URL for the seller-bucket object, minted **only after** `GetEntitlements` confirms an ACTIVE subscription |

## Catalog & discovery

Discovery is **manifest-driven** — the host never lists buckets (the artifacts
and seller buckets permit `GetObject` only, not `ListObjectsV2`).

- A single **`catalog.json`** lists every feature, OSS and marketplace, with
  the metadata the UI needs (displayName, version, `source`, and — for
  marketplace features — `productCode` + `marketplaceListingUrl`).
- `catalog.json` is produced by **`idp-cli publish`**, which merges the
  open-source features it bundles with the curated closed-source list in
  **`config_library/extensions-marketplace.yaml`** (the single checked-in source
  of truth for marketplace extensions).
- At **deploy time** the main stack's `ConfigurationCopyFunction` copies
  `catalog.json` (with the rest of `config_library/`) into the stack's own
  **ConfigurationBucket**. At **runtime** `listCatalogFeatures` reads it from
  ConfigurationBucket with one `GetObject` — so the **deployed stack does not
  depend on the artifacts bucket** for the catalog.
- To add a marketplace extension: add an entry to
  `config_library/extensions-marketplace.yaml`, re-publish, and run a stack update
  (the catalog is refreshed into ConfigurationBucket on create/update). The
  feature then appears in the "Extensions" nav with a Subscribe CTA.

The seller bucket is the one inherent post-deploy runtime dependency for
marketplace features: `getFeatureLaunchUrl` must presign a `GetObject` against
it (after the entitlement check) at the moment an entitled admin clicks
"Launch". The seller bucket's own bucket policy must grant the host's
feature-platform role `s3:GetObject`, and the host stack must list the seller
bucket's object ARN in `SellerBucketObjectArns`.

### "Update available" badges

The "Update available" badge an installed extension shows in the **Extensions**
nav compares the version recorded in the `InstalledFeatures` table against the
catalog's `latestVersion` for that feature — both read with a single `GetObject`
of `catalog.json`, no bucket listing. So an update is detected whenever a newer
catalog ships, which for **OSS extensions** happens on the next host stack
update (the catalog is re-copied into ConfigurationBucket).

> **Marketplace limitation (current).** Because the catalog is refreshed only on
> a host stack create/update, a new *marketplace* extension version published to
> a seller bucket is **not** surfaced as "Update available" until the host stack
> is updated with a re-published catalog carrying the new `latestVersion`. The
> host does not poll seller buckets at runtime (it can't — `GetObject` only, no
> listing, and no version index). Live marketplace update detection is deferred;
> for now, bump `latestVersion` in `config_library/extensions-marketplace.yaml`
> and re-publish to advertise a new marketplace version.

The separate Build Info **"update available"** indicator for the *accelerator
itself* works differently: `idp-cli publish` writes a small pointer object,
`<prefix>/idp-main-latest.json` (`{version, templateUrl}`), to the public
artifacts bucket on every release, and the `getLatestPublishedVersion` resolver
reads that one known key with a single `GetObject` (no `ListObjectsV2`, so it
works against the public release bucket). The check is disabled when
`PUBLIC_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET` is unset.

### Moving pieces

| Component | Lives in | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `FeaturePlatformStack` | nested stack from `feature-platform/main-stack-extensions/template.yaml` | Owns the `InstalledFeatures` table, the feature-platform Lambdas, and AppSync data sources / resolvers |
| `FeatureBucket` | main `template.yaml`, condition-gated on `EnableFeaturePlatform` | Holds the catalog of published features (CFN template + UI bundle + `feature.yaml` manifest per feature). Auto-created and pre-populated with the bundled sample feature unless `FeaturePlatformFeatureBucket` is supplied. |
| Pipeline hooks | `patterns/unified/` (`PipelineHooksDispatcherFunction` + `postHook` config) | Lets features inject Lambdas at six post-step extension points in the processing workflow. Inert when no hooks are registered. |
| Feature stack | standalone CFN template published by the author via `idp-feature-cli publish` | Creates the feature's own resources + registers into the main stack |

### GraphQL surface

| Operation | Auth | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `listCatalogFeatures: [CatalogFeature]` | Cognito user | Features published to the feature bucket (includes not-yet-installed) |
| `listInstalledFeatures: [InstalledFeature]` | Cognito user | Features whose stack has been launched & registered |
| `checkFeatureEntitlement(featureId): FeatureEntitlement` | Cognito user | `NONE` / `ACTIVE` / `EXPIRED`, with `expiresAt` + `source`. Returns `ACTIVE`/`auto` in auto-subscribe mode. |
| `getFeatureLaunchUrl(featureId): FeatureLaunchUrl` | Cognito user (Admin for launching) | Pre-signed CFN quick-create URL |
| `subscribeFeature(featureId): FeatureEntitlement` | Admin group | Calls the marketplace/simulator admin API (errors in auto-subscribe mode) |
| `unsubscribeFeature(featureId): FeatureEntitlement` | Admin group | Calls the marketplace/simulator admin API |
| `registerFeature(input): InstalledFeature` | IAM (feature stack CR) | Feature stack registers itself on create |
| `registerFeatureHooks(input): FeatureHooksRegistration` | IAM (feature stack CR) | Feature stack registers pipeline hooks |

Each GraphQL operation is backed by a Lambda under
`feature-platform/main-stack-extensions/lambdas/`.

## Pipeline hooks

Features can inject custom Lambdas at six post-step extension points in the
unified processing workflow: `postOcr`, `postClassification`, `postExtraction`,
`postAssessment`, `postRuleValidation`, `postSummarization`. After each step the
Step Functions workflow invokes `PipelineHooksDispatcherFunction`, which runs
any hook Lambdas registered for that point.

**Inert by default** — hooks are stored inline in the active configuration
version under each step's `postHook` list. With no `postHook` entries the
dispatcher returns after a single DynamoDB read and the pipeline is unchanged.

**`postHook` entry shape** (per step, in the active config version):

```yaml
extraction:
  postHook:
    - featureId: my-feature     # owner label (for traceability)
      arn: <hook-lambda-arn>    # Lambda to invoke
      order: 100                # lower runs first within a point (default 100)
      onError: continue         # continue | skip-remaining | fail (default continue)
      enabled: true             # default true
```

**Hook Lambda contract** — invoked synchronously (`RequestResponse`) with:

```json
{ "hookPoint": "postExtraction", "featureId": "my-feature",
  "document": { ... }, "section": { ... }, "executionArn": "arn:aws:states:..." }
```

It returns any JSON result (surfaced under `$.HookResults`). `onError`
controls failure handling: `continue` (log and proceed), `skip-remaining` (stop
later hooks at that point), or `fail` (fail the workflow).

**Security** — the dispatcher's `lambda:InvokeFunction` is scoped so a hook
Lambda must either carry the `idp:feature-id` resource tag (ABAC, used by
installed features) or follow the `GENAIIDP-*` naming convention; anything else
fails closed with `AccessDenied`.

Features register hooks at install time via the `registerFeatureHooks`
mutation (declared in the manifest's `pipelineHooks` field); admins can also
edit a config version's `postHook` lists directly. See the
[Developer Guide → Pipeline hooks](feature-platform-developer-guide.md#optional-pipeline-hooks).

## Config presets

A feature can bundle an accelerator configuration (custom classes, prompts,
rule-validation policy classes, …) and apply it at install via the manifest's
`configPreset` field. The feature stack calls the host's
`applyFeatureConfigPreset` mutation, which writes the preset as a **new,
non-active** configuration version named `<featureId>-v<version>`. Installation
never changes the active configuration — an admin reviews and activates the
preset from the **Configuration** page. Uninstall calls
`removeFeatureConfigPreset`, which removes the feature's preset versions but
preserves one that is currently active.

This is how a vertical feature ships "the configuration it needs" alongside its
UI and hooks. See the
[Developer Guide → ship a configuration preset](feature-platform-developer-guide.md#optional-ship-a-configuration-preset).

## Two reference samples

Both bundled extensions are **samples** — reference implementations for feature
authors, not production products. They're labelled accordingly in the nav (each
display name starts with `Sample:`). In particular, *Sample: Health Insurance
Review* is a minimal demo of a use-case extension; it is **not** the planned
Claims Processing marketplace product.

| Sample (nav label) | featureId | Kind | Demonstrates |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---- | ------------ |
| [Sample: Document Status (feature add-on)](extensions/sample-document-status.md) | `docs-by-status` | feature add-on | The minimal contract: UI bundle, Cognito-auth HTTP API over the tracking table, registration. |
| [Sample: Health Insurance Review](extensions/sample-health-insurance-review.md) | `sample-health-insurance-review` | use-case add-on | An advanced vertical: a bundled config preset, a `postRuleValidation` pipeline hook computing claim status, host-GraphQL Rules Discovery, and a multi-route feature API — built on [rule validation](rule-validation.md). |

## Deployment

```bash
# Default — feature platform on, auto-subscribe mode (no entitlement endpoint)
idp-cli deploy
```

```bash
# Bolt entitlement checks onto a running stack (no rebuild) — deploy the
# standalone marketplace-simulator separately, then point the stack at it:
idp-cli deploy --params FeaturePlatformSimulatorEndpoint=https://simulator.example.com
```

The default brings up:

- the main IDP stack,
- the `InstalledFeatures` DDB table + feature-platform Lambdas,
- the `FeatureBucket` pre-loaded with the bundled sample feature.

To turn the feature platform off entirely, set `EnableFeaturePlatform=false` —
no platform resources are created, and the nav shows no feature entries.

### Tear-down

```bash
idp-cli delete
```

All feature-platform resources carry `DeletionPolicy: Delete`, including the
DDB table and the auto-created feature bucket, so the stack tears down
cleanly. Any feature stacks the admin launched separately must be deleted by
the admin (they live in the same account but are outside the main stack's
dependency graph).

## Authoring a feature

> **Full walkthrough:** the [Feature Platform Developer Guide](feature-platform-developer-guide.md)
> covers the whole lifecycle for both OSS and Marketplace extensions — scaffold,
> host contract, adding to the catalog, publishing, and local testing. The
> summary below is the quick version.

Scaffold a new feature project from the bundled template with one CLI command:

```bash
pip install -e lib/idp_feature_sdk
idp-feature-cli init ./my-feature \
    --feature-id my-feature \
    --display-name "My Feature"
```

This copies `feature-platform/feature-template/` into `./my-feature` and
substitutes the placeholder featureId / displayName / version literals
throughout (`feature.yaml`, `template.yaml`, `entry.tsx`, `App.tsx`,
`package.json`, `handler.py`, `README.md`), giving you a working feature you can
iterate on. Then:

```bash
idp-feature-cli validate ./my-feature       # validate against the manifest schema
idp-feature-cli build ./my-feature           # build CFN + Lambda + UMD UI bundle
idp-feature-cli publish ./my-feature \        # upload artifacts + print Launch Stack URL
    --bucket-basename <your-feature-bucket> \   # region appended automatically (matches `idp-cli publish`)
    --region us-east-1
```

Once published, the new feature appears in the IDP nav automatically (the UI
fetches the catalog from the feature bucket via `listCatalogFeatures` — no
main-stack rebuild needed).

The host contract a feature must satisfy:

- **UI bundle** — a UMD module that calls
  `window.IdpFeatures.register(featureId, { Component, version, displayName })`
  and resolves React / ReactDOM / Cloudscape / aws-amplify / react-router-dom
  from `window.*` externals (so it shares the host's React instance — see
  `src/ui/src/components/feature-page/feature-host-globals.ts`).
- **CFN template** — registers itself via the `registerFeature` mutation from a
  custom resource on create, and uploads its UI bundle into
  `WebUIBucket/features/<id>/v<ver>/`.
- **`feature.yaml` manifest** — validated against
  `lib/idp_feature_sdk/idp_feature_sdk/schemas/feature-manifest.schema.json`.

## Cost

In the default (auto-subscribe) mode:

- Extra cost: pennies/month (DDB on-demand + feature-platform Lambdas at idle +
  S3 feature bucket).
- Extra resources: S3 feature bucket, DDB `InstalledFeatures` table,
  feature-platform Lambdas + log groups + IAM roles, the pipeline-hooks
  dispatcher Lambda.
- No EC2.

With `EnableFeaturePlatform=false`, none of the above are created.
