# Creating Custom Test Sets with Ground Truth

This guide walks through the end-to-end workflow for creating a custom test set with ground truth (evaluation baseline) data from scratch. Once created, the test set can be used for:

- **Benchmarking** — Compare accuracy across different models and configurations
- **Cost optimization** — Find the cheapest model that meets your accuracy requirements
- **Prompt engineering** — Measure the impact of prompt and schema changes
- **Custom model training** — Provide labeled training data for fine-tuning (see [Custom Model Fine-Tuning](./custom-model-finetuning.md))

> **Pre-deployed test sets**: The accelerator ships with four ready-to-use benchmark datasets. If you just want to run tests against those, see [Test Studio — Pre-Deployed Test Sets](./test-studio.md#pre-deployed-test-sets). This guide is for creating your **own** test set from your own documents.

```

## Step 1: Configure for Maximum Accuracy

The goal of this initial run is to produce predictions that are as accurate as possible, minimizing the amount of manual editing you'll need to do later. Use the best available model for both classification and extraction.

1. Go to **Configuration** in the web UI
2. Create a new configuration version (or edit an existing one)
3. Set both the **classification model** and **extraction model** to a high-accuracy model (e.g., Claude Opus)
4. Save the configuration version

> **Tip**: You can always create a cheaper configuration later for production use. The expensive model is only used here to bootstrap high-quality ground truth.

For details on configuration management, see [Configuration](./configuration.md) and [Configuration Versions](./configuration-versions.md).

## Step 2: Discover the Document Schema

If you don't already have document classes defined for your document type, use Discovery to bootstrap the schema automatically.

1. Go to **Discovery** in the web UI
2. Select your high-accuracy configuration version
3. Upload a representative sample document
4. Run discovery — it will analyze the document and populate document classes and attributes

After discovery completes, verify the schema in your configuration under **Document Schema**. You should see the discovered document class with its attributes populated.

For details on discovery modes and options, see [Discovery](./discovery.md).

## Step 3: Process Your Sample Documents

Now process a set of sample documents that will become your test set.

1. Go to **Upload Documents** in the web UI
2. Select your high-accuracy configuration version
3. Upload your sample documents
4. Wait for all documents to finish processing

> **How many documents?** For illustration, a handful of documents is fine. For a meaningful benchmark test set, aim for a larger representative sample. For custom model training, you'll need a significant number of labeled documents — see [Custom Model Fine-Tuning](./custom-model-finetuning.md) for guidance on training data requirements.

## Step 4: Review, Edit, and Save Ground Truth

This is the most important step. You'll review each document's predictions, correct any errors, and save the corrected version as evaluation baseline (ground truth).

### Review and Edit Predictions

For each processed document:

1. Open the document from the document list
2. Click **View Data** to see the extracted information
3. Click **Edit Data** to enter edit mode
4. Review each extracted field:
   - Click on a field to highlight it in the document viewer
   - Compare the extracted value against the source document
   - Correct any errors by editing the field value directly
5. **Save** your changes — the system creates a revision history of all edits

> **Tip**: The solution generates a confidence score for each field. To save time, you could focus on reviewing lower-confidence fields first. However, for the highest quality ground truth, review all fields.

### Save as Evaluation Baseline

Once you're confident the predictions are correct for a document:

1. Click the **Use as Evaluation Baseline** button
2. The system copies the corrected predictions to the evaluation baseline bucket

Repeat this for every document you want to include in your test set.

For details on the editing interface, see [Web UI — Edit Data](./web-ui.md#edit-data). For details on the evaluation baseline concept, see [Evaluation Framework](./evaluation.md).

## Step 5: Create the Test Set

Now register a test set that references your documents and their ground truth.

1. Go to **Test Studio** → **Test Sets** tab
2. Click **Add Test Set**
3. Give the test set a name
4. Specify the input bucket path containing your processed files
5. Verify the file count matches your expectations
6. Click **Add Test Set**

For details on test set management, see [Test Studio](./test-studio.md).

## Step 6: Run Test Executions and Compare

With your test set created, you can now run test executions to compare different configurations.

### Run a Baseline Test

1. Go to **Test Studio** → **Test Executions** tab
2. Select your test set
3. Choose the high-accuracy configuration version you used to create the ground truth
4. Run the test

This establishes your baseline — it should show near-perfect accuracy since the ground truth was generated from these same model predictions.

### Compare with Alternative Configurations

Create and test alternative configurations to find the best cost/accuracy balance:

1. Create a new configuration version with a cheaper model (e.g., Nova Lite)
2. Run a test execution against the same test set using the new configuration
3. Use the **comparison view** to analyze the results side-by-side

### Analyzing Results

The comparison view shows:

- **Overall accuracy** — How each configuration performed against the ground truth
- **Cost comparison** — Total processing cost for each configuration
- **Field-level metrics** — Which specific fields lost accuracy with the cheaper model

This data helps you identify:
- Whether a cheaper model meets your accuracy requirements
- Which fields need attention (e.g., improved prompts, better attribute descriptions)
- The cost/accuracy tradeoff for your specific document type

For details on evaluation metrics and reporting, see [Evaluation Framework](./evaluation.md) and [Enhanced Reporting](./evaluation-enhanced-reporting.md).

## Incrementally Growing Your Test Set

You don't have to create your entire test set in one go. As you process and review more documents over time, you can add them to an existing test set:

1. Process new documents and save their evaluation baselines (Steps 3-4 above)
2. Go to **Test Studio** → **Test Sets** tab
3. Select your existing test set and click **Add Documents** → **From Existing Files**
4. Select the **Input Bucket** and enter a file pattern matching your new documents
5. Optionally use the **Modified after** filter (e.g., "Last 24 hours") to easily find recently reviewed documents
6. Click **Check Files** to preview matches, then **Add Documents**

Files without matching baseline data are automatically excluded, so you can use a broad pattern — only documents you've reviewed and saved as evaluation baselines will be added. The test set's file count is updated automatically.

## Next Steps

- **Improve accuracy**: Use field-level metrics to refine your document class descriptions, attribute prompts, and few-shot examples. See [IDP Configuration Best Practices](./idp-configuration-best-practices.md) and [Few-Shot Examples](./few-shot-examples.md).
- **Train a custom model**: If your test set is large enough, use it to fine-tune a custom model. See [Custom Model Fine-Tuning](./custom-model-finetuning.md).
- **Automate with CLI/SDK**: Create and run test sets programmatically. See [IDP CLI](./idp-cli.md) and [IDP SDK](./idp-sdk.md).
