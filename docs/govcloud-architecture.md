# GovCloud Architecture

This document describes the architectural differences between the standard
(commercial AWS) deployment and the two GovCloud deployment variants of the
GenAI IDP Accelerator.

For deployment instructions and how to choose between the variants, see the
[GovCloud Deployment Guide](./govcloud-deployment.md).

## Two GovCloud Variants

GovCloud lacks two services the standard template uses — **Amazon CloudFront**
and **Lambda Function URLs** — so the standard template cannot deploy there.
`idp-cli` provides two mutually exclusive template transforms:

| | **`--govcloud`** (Web UI) | **`--headless`** |
|---|---|---|
| **What is removed** | Only CloudFront and Lambda Function URLs | The entire UI and everything that serves it (see below) |
| **Web UI** | ✅ Full React UI, served by API Gateway | ❌ Removed |
| **Authentication** | Cognito (as in commercial) | IAM; optional OAuth2 for the Jobs API |
| **Chat / agents / Test Studio / HITL / knowledge base** | ✅ Retained | ❌ Removed |

> `--headless` is not GovCloud-specific — it works in any region. See the
> [Headless Deployment Guide](./headless-deployment.md).

## Architecture Comparison

### Standard AWS Deployment (commercial)

    D --> E[Cognito Authentication]
    D --> F[Core Processing Engine]
    F --> G[Document Workflows]
    G --> H[S3 Storage]
```

### GovCloud `--govcloud` (Web UI, no CloudFront)

```mermaid

    A[Users] --> B[API Gateway REST API<br/>serves Web UI + UI resolvers]
    B --> E[Cognito Authentication]
    B --> F[Core Processing Engine]
    F --> G[Document Workflows]
    G --> H[S3 Storage]
```

The same REST API that backs the UI also serves the UI's static assets as an
S3 proxy (`WebUIHosting=APIGateway` — see
[API Gateway Hosting](./apigateway-hosting.md)). Chat works without the
streaming Function URL by falling back to a non-streaming polling path — see
[Chat in GovCloud](./govcloud-deployment.md#chat-in-govcloud-non-streaming).

### GovCloud `--headless`

    G --> H[S3 Storage]
```

## What `--govcloud` Removes

Only the two resource families that do not exist in GovCloud:

- **All `AWS::CloudFront::*` resources** (distribution, origin access control,
  security headers policy) and the CloudFront-only parameters/conditions. The
  Web UI is instead served by API Gateway.
- **The `AWS::Lambda::Url` resource** — the chat *streaming* endpoint. The UI
  auto-detects its absence and polls for chat answers instead; the final
  answer is identical.

Everything else — Cognito authentication, the UI REST API, WAF, agents, MCP,
Test Studio, HITL, knowledge base, discovery, configuration UI — is retained
and works as in commercial regions.

## What `--headless` Removes

The headless transform strips the following resource groups (matching the
`HeadlessTemplateTransformer` in
`lib/idp_sdk/idp_sdk/_core/template_transform.py`):

### Web UI Hosting

- CloudFront distribution, origin access control, and security headers policy
- Web UI S3 bucket and its CodeBuild build/deploy pipeline

### UI API Layer

- The API Gateway REST API nested stack (`APIRESOLVERSTACK`) hosting the
  dispatcher and all UI resolver Lambdas — including Test Studio, evaluation,
  configuration, and document-query resolvers. (This stack replaced the
  former AWS AppSync GraphQL API, which has been removed from the solution
  entirely.)
- UI-only resolver Lambdas in the main template (capacity planning, version
  check, fine-tuning)
- API Gateway Web UI hosting resources (S3 proxy role, Cognito OAuth callback
  registration)

### Authentication

- Cognito User Pool, Identity Pool, user pool client and domain
- Admin user and group management (Admin, Author, Reviewer, Viewer groups)
- Email domain verification functions
- External Identity Provider (SAML/OIDC) integration

### WAF Security

- WAF WebACL, IP sets, and IP set updater functions

### Agents & MCP

- Agent table, agent request handler and processor functions
- AgentCore Gateway and MCP integration resources (gateway manager, analytics
  Lambda, MCP handler, connector/resource-server clients)
- External MCP agent credentials secret
- Text-to-SQL / analytics query capabilities

### Chat

- Chat-with-document processor and the chat streaming Function URL family
- The Step Functions → UI status publisher (fed real-time document status to
  the web UI)

### HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)

- SageMaker A2I flow definition, human task UI, and private workforce
  configuration
- Users table and user management functions
- Section review workflow resolvers

### Knowledge Base

- Bedrock Knowledge Base nested stack (`DOCUMENTKB`) and query functions

### Discovery & Feature Platform

- Discovery bucket, queues, tracking table, processor functions, blueprint
  optimization, and the multi-doc discovery state machine
- The Feature Platform nested stack (`EnableFeaturePlatform` is forced off)

## Core Services Retained

All core document-processing functionality is retained in both variants:

### Document Processing

- ✅ Unified processing workflow with both modes:
  - **Pipeline mode** (Textract OCR + Bedrock classification/extraction) —
    the GovCloud default, via the `lending-package-sample-govcloud`
    configuration preset (pins GovCloud-available Bedrock models)
  - **BDA mode** (`use_bda: true`) — Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is
    available in `us-gov-west-1` (planned for `us-gov-east-1`)
- ✅ Complete pipeline (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment,
  Summarization, Evaluation)
- ✅ Step Functions workflows and Lambda processing
- ✅ Custom prompt Lambda integration

### Storage & Data

- ✅ S3 buckets (Input, Output, Working, Configuration, Logging)
- ✅ DynamoDB tables (Tracking, Configuration, Concurrency)
- ✅ Data encryption with customer-managed KMS keys
- ✅ Lifecycle policies and data retention

### Monitoring & Operations

- ✅ CloudWatch dashboards and metrics
- ✅ CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications
- ✅ Lambda function logging and tracing
- ✅ Step Functions execution logging

### Integration

- ✅ SQS queues for document processing
- ✅ EventBridge rules for workflow orchestration
- ✅ Post-processing Lambda hooks
- ✅ Evaluation and reporting systems

## Headless Limitations and Workarounds

These apply to `--headless` only — the `--govcloud` variant keeps the full UI.

### ❌ Removed Features

- Web-based user interface and interactive configuration management
- Document status monitoring in the UI
- User authentication and authorization via Cognito
- WAF security rules and IP filtering
- Agent chat, chat with document, and analytics query interfaces
- Human-in-the-loop review workflows
- Document knowledge base

### ✅ Available Workarounds

- Use S3 direct upload, `idp-cli`, the SDK, or the optional
  [Batch Jobs REST API](./govcloud-batch-api.md) instead of the web UI
- Monitor through CloudWatch dashboards and the Step Functions console (see
  [GovCloud Operations](./govcloud-operations.md))
- Manage configuration via `idp-cli deploy --custom-config` or the
  Configuration bucket
- Use IAM (or the Jobs API's OAuth2 client credentials) for authentication
- Access processing results directly from the Output S3 bucket
- Query evaluation/reporting data through Athena directly
