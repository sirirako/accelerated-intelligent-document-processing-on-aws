# GovCloud Deployment Guide

Deploy the GenAI IDP Accelerator to AWS GovCloud (`us-gov-west-1` /
`us-gov-east-1`) with a single `idp-cli` command. There are two deployment
paths — pick one:

| | **Web UI: `--govcloud`** (recommended) | **Headless: `--headless`** |
|---|---|---|
| **Web UI** | ✅ Full React UI, served by API Gateway (no CloudFront) | ❌ Removed |
| **Chat / agents** | ✅ Works, non-streaming — see [Chat in GovCloud](#chat-in-govcloud-non-streaming) | ❌ Removed |
| **Authentication** | Cognito (same as commercial) | IAM; or OAuth2 client credentials for the optional Jobs API |
| **Access methods** | Web UI, S3 upload, `idp-cli`, SDK | S3 upload, `idp-cli`, SDK, optional `/jobs` REST API |
| **Network options** | Public, IP-restricted (WAF), or VPC-only (private API Gateway) | No VPC, or all-in-VPC (+ optional bastion host) |
| **When to choose** | You want the interactive UI in GovCloud | Programmatic-only pipelines, or policy prohibits Cognito / WAF / a UI |

Both paths:

- **Build from local source** (`--from-code .`) — public pre-built templates
  are not published for GovCloud regions.
- Use `arn:${AWS::Partition}:` ARNs throughout, so all references resolve in
  the `aws-us-gov` partition.
- Remove services that do not exist in GovCloud — CloudFront and Lambda
  Function URLs. `--headless` additionally removes the entire UI, Cognito,
  WAF, agents, HITL, and knowledge base. See
  [GovCloud Architecture](./govcloud-architecture.md) for the full removed
  vs. retained resource list.
- Are validated with `cfn-lint` during the build. The `--govcloud` transform
  additionally runs a **region-aware lint** against the target GovCloud region
  right after the transform: if any GovCloud-unsupported resource type
  survives (an `E3006` error), the `publish`/`deploy` fails loudly instead of
  surfacing the problem only at deploy time. (`cfn-lint` runs fully offline;
  if not installed the gate is skipped with a warning.)

The two flags are **mutually exclusive** — `--headless` removes the UI
entirely; `--govcloud` keeps it.

> **Legacy**: The `scripts/generate_govcloud_template.py` script is
> deprecated. Use `idp-cli deploy --govcloud --from-code .` or
> `idp-cli deploy --headless --from-code .` instead.

## Prerequisites

Install on the machine you build from:

1. bash shell (Linux, MacOS, Windows-WSL)
2. aws (AWS CLI)
3. [sam (AWS SAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
4. Python 3.12 (required to generate templates)
5. Node.js >=22.12.0 and npm >=10.0.0
6. A local Docker daemon
7. The IDP CLI and SDK packages — run `make setup-venv` from the project root
   to create a `.venv` with everything installed, then
   `source .venv/bin/activate`.

Also request access to the default Bedrock models in your GovCloud region
before processing documents: `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`, `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`,
`us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`, and
`anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`.

> **Note**: The CLI creates the artifacts S3 bucket automatically. Customize
> with `--bucket-basename` and `--prefix`.

> **Note on `--parameters` formatting**: Commas inside multi-value parameters
> (like `PrivateSubnetIds`) don't need escaping — the CLI parses
> `--parameters` by looking for the next `key=` pattern, so commas within
> values are preserved automatically.

## Keeping the Web UI in GovCloud: `--govcloud`

GovCloud lacks two services the standard UI template uses — Amazon CloudFront
and Lambda Function URLs — so the standard template fails to even validate
there (`E3006 Resource type 'AWS::CloudFront::Distribution' does not exist in
'us-gov-west-1'`). The `--govcloud` flag transforms the template to:

- Remove every `AWS::CloudFront::*` resource and force
  `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`, so the Web UI is served as an S3 proxy on the
  same REST API that backs it (see
  [API Gateway Hosting](./apigateway-hosting.md)).
- Remove the `AWS::Lambda::Url` resource (the chat *streaming* endpoint),
  since [Lambda Function URLs are not available in GovCloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-lambda.html).
  Chat still works — the UI automatically switches to a non-streaming path
  (see [Chat in GovCloud](#chat-in-govcloud-non-streaming) below).

Everything else in the UI (Cognito auth, the REST API, WAF, document
processing, extraction, evaluation, Test Studio, discovery, knowledge base,
configuration) works as in commercial regions.

### Web UI, internet-facing

The simplest UI deployment. `--admin-email` is required for new stacks
(Cognito is retained; the initial temporary password is emailed to you).

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name my-idp-govcloud \
  --region us-gov-west-1 \
  --from-code . \
  --govcloud \
  --admin-email your.email@example.com \
  --wait
```

To restrict access by source IP, add a WAF allow-list (the default
`0.0.0.0/0` disables WAF):

```bash
  --parameters "WAFAllowedIPv4Ranges=203.0.113.0/24,198.51.100.0/24"
```

### Web UI, VPC-only (private API Gateway)

Serves the UI and its API only through your VPC's `execute-api` interface
endpoint. Requires `DeployInVPC=true` plus your VPC networking parameters —
see [API Gateway Hosting](./apigateway-hosting.md) and
[VPC Secured Mode](./vpc-secured-mode.md) for prerequisites.

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name my-idp-govcloud \
  --region us-gov-west-1 \
  --from-code . \
  --govcloud \
  --admin-email your.email@example.com \
  --wait \
  --parameters "ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE,DeployInVPC=true,VpcId=vpc-xxxxxxxx,PrivateSubnetIds=subnet-a,subnet-b,LambdaSubnetIds=subnet-a,subnet-b,LambdaSecurityGroupId=sg-xxxxxxxx,ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId=vpce-xxxxxxxx"
```

### Build the GovCloud template without deploying

```bash
idp-cli publish --source-dir . --region us-gov-west-1 --govcloud
```

The transformed template is written to `.aws-sam/idp-govcloud.yaml` and
uploaded as `idp-govcloud.yaml`. Deploy it later with
`idp-cli deploy --template-file .aws-sam/idp-govcloud.yaml ...` or through
the CloudFormation console.

### Chat in GovCloud (non-streaming)

With `--govcloud`, agent chat and document chat work, but without live
token streaming:

- **Commercial (streaming):** the browser opens a streaming connection to a
  Lambda Function URL and renders the answer token-by-token, including
  intermediate agent progress ("calling tool X…").
- **GovCloud (non-streaming):** the browser sends the chat message over the
  REST API, which asynchronously invokes the same chat processor; the UI then
  **polls** for the final answer. The user sees a spinner until the complete
  answer appears at once. **The final answer is identical to streaming.**

This is auto-detected — the UI streams when a Function URL is configured
(`VITE_STREAM_URL`) and polls when it is not; no configuration is needed. The
polling path reuses the Cognito-authed REST API, so it inherits the same
`ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE` / WAF posture as the rest of the UI. Long agent
turns are supported (the UI polls for up to 5 minutes).

## Headless Deployment: `--headless`

`--headless` removes the Web UI and everything that exists to serve it
(UI REST API resolvers, Cognito UI auth, WAF, agents, HITL, knowledge
base), keeping the full document-processing backend. See the
[Headless Deployment Guide](./headless-deployment.md) for the general
(non-GovCloud-specific) reference.

> **`--headless` vs. `EnableHeadless=true`** — these are different things:
>
> - `--headless` (CLI flag) transforms the **template**: it strips the UI
>   resource groups above. It does **not** set any stack parameters.
> - `EnableHeadless=true` (CloudFormation parameter) additionally deploys the
>   **Batch Jobs REST API** (`/jobs` endpoints on a private API Gateway with
>   OAuth2 machine-to-machine auth). It requires `DeployInVPC=true` plus your
>   VPC parameters — the template rejects it otherwise at changeset creation.
>
> If you want the Jobs API you must pass `EnableHeadless=true` and the VPC
> parameters explicitly, as in [Option B](#option-b-headless--jobs-rest-api-all-lambdas-in-vpc) below.

### Deployment Packages

| | Option A: Vanilla | Option B: Jobs REST API (VPC) | Option C: + Bastion |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Use case** | Simplest deployment; drive processing via S3 upload or IDP CLI | Production API access with all compute isolated in your VPC | Development/testing: call the private API from your laptop via SSM tunnel |
| **Access methods** | S3 direct upload, IDP CLI, SDK | Vanilla methods + `/jobs` REST API (private API Gateway) | Same, plus local access through the bastion tunnel |
| **Networking** | No VPC required | All Lambdas + private API Gateway in your VPC | Same, plus an EC2 bastion host (SSM only, no inbound rules) |
| **Authentication** | IAM only | Cognito client credentials (OAuth2 bearer tokens) | Same as Option B |
| **Extra parameters** | None | `EnableHeadless=true`, `DeployInVPC=true`, `VpcId`, `PrivateSubnetIds`, `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId`, `LambdaSecurityGroupId` | Option B + `DeployBastionHost=true`, `BastionHostSubnetId`, `BastionHostSecurityGroupId` |

#### Option A: Vanilla (no API, no VPC)

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name my-idp-headless \
  --region us-gov-west-1 \
  --from-code . \
  --headless \
  --wait
```

No `--admin-email` is needed — the headless template has no Cognito user
pool. Interact with the stack via direct S3 upload, `idp-cli`, or the SDK
(see [Processing documents](#processing-documents-headless) below).

#### Option B: Headless + Jobs REST API (all Lambdas in VPC)

Deploys the `/jobs` REST API as a **private** API Gateway reachable only
through your VPC's `execute-api` interface endpoint, with all Lambda
functions inside your VPC. Make sure the
[VPC Secured Mode prerequisites](./vpc-secured-mode.md) are met first.

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name my-idp-headless \
  --region us-gov-west-1 \
  --from-code . \
  --headless \
  --wait \
  --parameters "EnableHeadless=true,DeployInVPC=true,VpcId=vpc-xxxxxxxxx,PrivateSubnetIds=subnet-xxxxx,subnet-xxxxx,ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId=vpce-xxxxxxxxx,LambdaSecurityGroupId=sg-xxxxxxxxx,ApiStageName=beta"
```

See [Batch Jobs REST API](./govcloud-batch-api.md) for authentication and
endpoint usage.

#### Option C: Option B + Bastion host (development)

Adds a small EC2 bastion (no inbound rules; access via AWS SSM Session
Manager) so you can tunnel to the private API from your local machine.

```bash
idp-cli deploy \
  --stack-name my-idp-headless \
  --region us-gov-west-1 \
  --from-code . \
  --headless \
  --wait \
  --parameters "EnableHeadless=true,DeployInVPC=true,VpcId=vpc-xxxxxxxxx,PrivateSubnetIds=subnet-xxxxx,subnet-xxxxx,ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId=vpce-xxxxxxxxx,LambdaSecurityGroupId=sg-xxxxxxxxx,ApiStageName=beta,DeployBastionHost=true,BastionHostSubnetId=subnet-xxxxxxxxx,BastionHostSecurityGroupId=sg-xxxxxxxxx"
```

See [Private API Access via Bastion Tunnel](./govcloud-batch-api.md#private-api-access-via-bastion-tunnel)
for tunnel setup (`./scripts/bastion.sh <STACK_NAME>`).

### Processing documents (headless)

Without the Web UI, use `idp-cli` for the full round trip:

```bash
# Upload and process a directory of documents, monitoring until completion
idp-cli run-inference \
    --stack-name my-idp-headless \
    --dir ./samples/ \
    --monitor

# Check status later (batch ID is printed by run-inference)
idp-cli status --stack-name my-idp-headless --batch-id <batch-id>

# Download the results
idp-cli download-results \
    --stack-name my-idp-headless \
    --batch-id <batch-id> \
    --output-dir ./results/
```

Or upload directly to the input bucket (name is in the stack Outputs) and
monitor via the Step Functions console link in the stack Outputs:

```bash
aws s3 cp my-document.pdf s3://<InputBucket>/my-document.pdf
```

## Updating an Existing Stack

Re-run the same `idp-cli deploy` command (same flags) to build and apply
template or code changes. Parameters you omit keep their previous values.

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

Monitoring (CloudWatch dashboard `{StackName}-{Region}`, alarms, log groups)
and operational troubleshooting are covered in
[GovCloud Operations](./govcloud-operations.md).

Common deployment issues:

- **Build failures** — re-run with `--verbose` (publish) to see detailed
  errors; ensure Docker is running and Node.js >= 22.12.
- **`E3006` cfn-lint errors during publish/deploy** — a GovCloud-unsupported
  resource type survived the transform; this is a bug worth reporting, not a
  local misconfiguration.
- **Processing failures** — confirm the default Bedrock models (listed under
  [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)) are enabled in your GovCloud region, then
  check CloudWatch logs.
- **"Region '…' is not supported" with `--govcloud`/`--headless` but without
  `--from-code`** — pre-built templates only exist for a few commercial
  regions; in GovCloud always pass `--from-code .` (or `--template-url`).

## Migration from Commercial AWS

1. **Export configuration** from the existing stack (Configuration bucket /
   `idp-cli`).
2. **Export data**: copy any evaluation baseline or reference data.
3. **Deploy to GovCloud** using one of the commands above.
4. **Import configuration** into the new stack (`--custom-config` or the UI).
5. **Validate** with sample documents.

## Cost & Compliance Notes

- GovCloud pricing differs from commercial regions — see
  [GovCloud Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/pricing/) and update
  `config_library/pricing.yaml` estimates if you rely on cost reporting.
- Both deployment paths keep customer-managed KMS encryption, data-retention
  lifecycle policies, and process everything within the GovCloud boundary —
  no data egress to commercial regions.
