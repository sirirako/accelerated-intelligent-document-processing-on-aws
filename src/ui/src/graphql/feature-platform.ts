 * GraphQL operation strings for the feature platform.
 *
 * These are raw strings rather than generated operations because the
 * feature-platform schema fragment is only merged into the main AppSync
 * schema when `EnableFeaturePlatform=true`, and codegen runs against a
 * single schema snapshot. Using raw strings lets the UI compile regardless
 * of whether the feature platform is turned on at build time.
 *
 * Use with: `import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api';`
 *           `client.graphql({ query: LIST_INSTALLED_FEATURES });`
