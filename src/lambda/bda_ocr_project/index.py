"""CloudFormation custom resource: stack-scoped BDA OCR project.

Provisions a per-stack Bedrock Data Automation *standard-output SYNC* project
used by the ``bda`` OCR backend, created on stack create and deleted on stack
delete. The project name is derived from the stack name so multiple stacks in
one account no longer share/interfere with a single account-global project.

The project configuration logic (standard-output config, jpeg/png->DOCUMENT
modality-routing override, routing-override repair, find/create/delete) is
**duplicated** from ``lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/bda/bda_ocr.py`` rather than
imported, because SAM's makefile builder runs against an isolated copy of this
function's CodeUri and cannot reach ``lib/`` at build time (and importing
``idp_common.bda`` would also pull the heavy ``bda_service`` / ``bda_invocation``
chain via ``idp_common/bda/__init__.py``). The library module is the canonical,
unit-tested source; the inlined config/sanitizer helpers must stay behaviorally
identical to it — a drift guard
(``tests/test_index.py::test_inlined_helpers_match_library``) asserts they
produce the same output. If you change one, change the other.
