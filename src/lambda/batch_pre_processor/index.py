Batch Pre-Processor Lambda

Extracts ZIP files from staging bucket and uploads individual files to the
input bucket for processing. Updates the job record with per-file status.

Safety bounds (configurable via env vars):
  * MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES — cap on the SUM of declared uncompressed sizes
    across the whole zip (default: 20 GB). Enforced before any upload begins
    so a malicious/oversized zip cannot exhaust Lambda memory or run the
    function to timeout before the caller sees a status.
  * MAX_ENTRIES — cap on the number of non-directory entries in the zip
    (default: 10,000).

Entries are streamed (zip_ref.open + s3.upload_fileobj) instead of loaded
whole into memory.

Per-entry failures (single-file upload errors) are isolated: the offending
filename is recorded with Status.FAILED on the job record and processing
continues with the remaining entries, so downstream JobTracker can converge
the job to PARTIALLY_SUCCEEDED / FAILED / SUCCEEDED as appropriate.
