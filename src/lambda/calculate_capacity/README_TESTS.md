# Capacity Planning Lambda Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the capacity planning Lambda functions.

## Running Tests

### Quick Start (Recommended)

The capacity planning tests are integrated into the main project test suite:

```bash
# From project root - install all dependencies (including test dependencies)
make setup

# Run all project tests (includes capacity planning)
make test

# Run only capacity planning tests
make test-capacity

# Run capacity planning tests with coverage
make test-capacity-coverage
```

### Manual Test Execution

If you prefer to run tests manually:

#### Install Test Dependencies

```bash
cd src/lambda/calculate_capacity
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

#### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run specific test file
pytest test_validation.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest test_validation.py::TestEnvironmentValidation -v

# Run specific test
pytest test_validation.py::TestEnvironmentValidation::test_validate_all_required_vars_present -v
```

### View Coverage Report

After running tests with coverage, open the HTML report:

```bash
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
start htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

## Test Organization

### `test_validation.py`
Tests for input validation and environment variable validation:
- Environment variable validation
- JSON input sanitization
- Capacity input parameter validation
- Caching of validated environment variables

### `test_capacity_calculations.py`
Tests for core capacity calculation logic:
- Latency distribution calculations
- Quota requirement calculations
- Decimal conversion utilities
- Recommendation generation

## Test Coverage Goals

Target: **80%+ code coverage** for critical functions

Priority areas:
1. ✅ Input validation (100% coverage)
2. ✅ Environment variable validation (100% coverage)
3. ✅ Quota calculations (80%+ coverage)
4. ✅ Latency calculations (80%+ coverage)
5. Decimal conversion (100% coverage)
6. Recommendation generation (60%+ coverage)

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality:

1. Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
2. Ensure tests cover:
   - Happy path
   - Error cases
   - Edge cases
   - Input validation
3. Maintain or improve coverage percentage
4. Update this README if new test files are added

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are automatically run as part of the main test suite in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Install dependencies
  run: make setup

- name: Run all tests (includes capacity planning)
  run: make test

# Or run with coverage enforcement
- name: Run capacity planning tests with coverage
  run: |
    cd src/lambda/calculate_capacity
    pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80
```

**Note**: The `make test` command now automatically includes capacity planning tests, so they run alongside all other project tests.

## Mock Environment Variables

Tests use `patch.dict(os.environ, ...)` to mock environment variables.

Required environment variables for tests:
- `TRACKING_TABLE`
- `METERING_TABLE_NAME`
- `LAMBDA_MEMORY_GB`
- `BEDROCK_MODEL_QUOTA_CODES`
- `BEDROCK_MODEL_RPM_QUOTA_CODES`
- All threshold environment variables

See `test_validation.py` for complete list.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you see import errors, ensure you're running tests from the correct directory:

```bash
cd src/lambda/calculate_capacity
python -m pytest
```

### Missing Dependencies

Install all test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### AWS Credential Errors

Tests mock AWS services using `moto`. If you see credential errors, ensure moto is installed:

```bash
pip install moto>=4.2.0
```
