# Run Benchmarks — GenAIIDP empirical config/scaling suite

Use this skill to run the benchmark suite in `benchmarks/` — an end-to-end,
ground-truth study across document types/sizes × configuration options that
quantifies success/completeness/accuracy/calibration/latency/tokens/cost. Use it
to (a) regenerate the results paper for a release, or (b) gate a code change by
comparing against the committed baseline.

> Read `benchmarks/matrices/METHODOLOGY.md` first — it defines the matrices,
> scoring, and reproducibility/honesty rules. Do NOT restate numbers from memory;
> everything comes from the harness output.

## Environment (two gotchas)
```bash
source /home/ec2-user/projects/idp1/.venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/projects/idp1/lib/idp_common_pkg   # avoid stale idp2/idp3 checkout
# All AWS + idp-cli calls use AWS_PROFILE=default (deployment acct); confirm:
AWS_PROFILE=default aws sts get-caller-identity
```
Requires `reportlab` + `matplotlib` in the venv (`pip install reportlab matplotlib`).

## Suites (pick by intent)
- `smoke` — 2 cells × 2 tiny docs. Per-PR gate (~minutes, ~$1).
- `core` — 10 decision-relevant cells × ~10 docs. Standard release run.
- `scaling` — simple vs advanced across the row-count series (the cliff study).
- `full` — core + one-axis sweeps of every knob. The deep study for the paper (expensive).

## Workflow
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/projects/idp1
# 1. build the exact-ground-truth synthetic corpus (deterministic)
python3 benchmarks/harness/gen_corpus.py                 # all synthetic docs
python3 benchmarks/harness/gen_corpus.py --series scaling # just the scaling series

# 2. expand the config matrix into validated v0.6 config variants
python3 benchmarks/harness/make_configs.py --suite <suite> --class bank_statement

# 3. (ALWAYS estimate first — full is expensive) then run against a deployed stack
AWS_PROFILE=default python3 benchmarks/harness/run_matrix.py --stack <STACK> --suite <suite> --estimate
AWS_PROFILE=default python3 benchmarks/harness/run_matrix.py --stack <STACK> --suite <suite> --max-inflight 6

# 4. score + roll up (writes results/<release>/summary.{json,csv} + meta.json)
AWS_PROFILE=default python3 benchmarks/harness/aggregate.py --run benchmarks/results/run-<stamp> --out benchmarks/results/<release>

# 5. regression-check vs baseline + emit figures
python3 benchmarks/harness/aggregate.py --compare benchmarks/results/<release>/summary.json --baseline benchmarks/results/baseline.json
python3 benchmarks/harness/aggregate.py --figures benchmarks/results/<release>/summary.json

# 6. update the published papers under docs/benchmarking/ (see "Output docs" below)
```

## Output docs (single source of truth = docs/benchmarking/)

Papers are published from `docs/benchmarking/` (symlinked into the Starlight site by
`docs-site/setup.sh`; sidebar in `docs-site/astro.config.mjs`). Do NOT create parallel
copies under `benchmarks/paper/` — that caused drift and is retired (see
`benchmarks/paper/README.md`).

| File | Purpose | Cadence |
|------|---------|---------|
| `docs/benchmarking/index.md` | how the suite works (design guide) | edit when the harness changes |
| `docs/benchmarking/config-guidance.md` | "which config should I pick?" (cross-config, one release) | refresh per release |
| `docs/benchmarking/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` | **release-vs-release** audit trail (one file per release, never overwritten) | one NEW file per release |
| `docs/benchmarking/releases/README.md` | audit-trail index table | append one row per release |

Figures: `aggregate.py --figures` writes to `benchmarks/paper/figures/` (scratch); copy
the ones you cite into `images/benchmark-<release>-<name>.png`. Docs reference them as
`../../images/...` (from `docs/benchmarking/`) or `../../../images/...` (from `releases/`).

## Release-cycle audit trail — "prev published release vs current develop"

This is the once-per-release deliverable and the reason the harness is version-agnostic.
It creates ONE new `docs/benchmarking/releases/v<NEW>.md` comparing the previous
**published** release to the current **develop** prerelease, on the same stack, with
**byte-identical configs** (only the code version differs). Entry point:
`make benchmark-release VERSION=<new> PREV=<published>` (which just invokes this skill).

Procedure (drive it yourself — several steps need judgment):

1. **Deploy the PREV published release.** Find the public template URL in `README.md`
   (`s3://aws-ml-blog-<region>/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml`); confirm its
   Description says `(v<PREV>)`. `idp-cli deploy --stack-name <S> --template-url <url>
   --admin-email <you> --region us-west-2 --wait`.
2. **Generate the `corefast` grid** (`gen_corpus.py`; `make_configs.py --suite corefast`).
   Use `corefast` (≤100-row docs) for the A/B — advanced-mode granular assessment on
   ≥400-row docs times out the 900s Lambda on older releases (retries ~2h then fails).
3. **Run on PREV with `--native-upload`** (`run_matrix.py --suite corefast --native-upload`).
   Native-upload is REQUIRED: idp-cli's config-upload force-migrates v0.5→v0.6 and drops
   the top-level `assessment` block older stacks need.
4. **Score** → `benchmarks/results/v<PREV>/`; **promote to baseline.json**.
5. **Upgrade the SAME stack in place**: `idp-cli deploy --stack-name <S> --from-code .
   --clean-build --region us-west-2 --wait`. Verify `UPDATE_COMPLETE` + Description shows
   `v<NEW>`.
6. **Re-run `corefast` on the upgraded stack** (`--native-upload`, identical config files).
7. **Score** → `benchmarks/results/v<NEW>/`; **compare** (`aggregate.py --compare` new vs
   PREV) + `--figures`; copy cited charts to `images/benchmark-v<NEW>-*.png`.
8. **Write `docs/benchmarking/releases/v<NEW>.md`** (use the previous release file as the
   template) and **append a row** to `docs/benchmarking/releases/README.md`.

### Cross-version config compatibility the harness handles (do NOT regress these)

Running the v0.6-native suite against an older stack requires these, all already in the
harness — verify they still hold when the schema evolves:
- **Shared control model.** Older clients reject newer models (v0.5.16's bedrock client
  sends deprecated `temperature` → Sonnet 5 `ValidationException`). Hold `extraction.model`
  at a model BOTH versions run (`default_cell.extraction_model`, currently `sonnet46`).
  Capability-only deltas (e.g. "vN unlocks Sonnet 5") are documented, not in the A/B grid.
- **`make_configs.py`** merges each cell with system defaults (so all step prompts are
  populated for old stacks that don't merge custom configs at runtime), re-injects a
  top-level `assessment` block from `compat/v0516-base-assessment.yaml` (old stacks read
  it; v0.6 ignores it via `extra="ignore"`), mirrors `confidence.list_batch_size` into
  `assessment.granular.list_batch_size` (equal Bedrock call counts = fair cost), sanitizes
  non-positive `max_tokens`/`shard_token_budget` (old validators enforce `gt=0`), and
  disables summarization (unscored; its default model hits the temperature bug).
- **`compat/native_upload.py`** writes configs verbatim (bypasses idp-cli migration).
- **`run_matrix.launch()`** invokes the TestRunner Lambda directly (finds it whether it's
  under `APPSYNCSTACK` (v0.5.x) or `APIRESOLVERSTACK` (v0.6)).
- **Validate against the OLD model** before running: `git worktree add -f --detach <wt>
  v<PREV>` then `IDPConfig.model_validate(cfg)` from `<wt>/lib/idp_common_pkg`.
- **Honesty:** report any cell that can't complete on a version (e.g. old-release
  advanced+large-list timeouts) as a finding, not a silent omission.

## Stack setup
- Use a deployed stack you own (e.g. IDPBattery0708). The harness resolves its
  testset/output buckets + tracking/config tables by name prefix.
- It registers `bench-<doc>` test sets and uploads `Config#bench-*` versions.
  **It never mutates `Config#default`.** Clean up afterwards if desired:
  `idp-cli config-delete --config-version bench-* ` (or leave for the next run).
- BDA and `bedrock_llm` OCR cells require those features enabled on the stack /
  Bedrock model access; cells that can't run are logged, not silently dropped.

## Promoting a baseline
After a release run you trust, copy its summary to the baseline so future runs
compare against it:
```bash
cp benchmarks/results/<release>/summary.json benchmarks/results/baseline.json
```
Commit `benchmarks/results/<release>/` + the updated `baseline.json` + paper so the
per-release history is maintained in the repo.

## Regression thresholds (in aggregate.py --compare)
accuracy −0.02, cost +15%, any new failure, calibration separation −0.03 → flagged
as regressions. Improvements ≥ +0.02 accuracy are also reported.

## Honesty
Report failures explicitly; never average accuracy only over docs that completed
without saying so (advanced/large runs are survivorship-sensitive). Costs are
estimates from `config_library/pricing.yaml` (state the rate date). Any capped or
skipped cell must appear in `meta.json`, not vanish.
