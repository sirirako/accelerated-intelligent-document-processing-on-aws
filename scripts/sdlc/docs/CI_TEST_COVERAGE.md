# CI/CD Automated Test Coverage

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline runs a comprehensive smoke test suite that validates all major IDP Accelerator features. Tests run in **parallel** with **fail-fast** behavior for rapid feedback.

## Pipeline stages & triggers

The GitLab pipeline has three stages, gated so cheap checks run everywhere and
the expensive AWS deploy runs only when it's worth it:

| Stage | Jobs | AWS? | Cost |
|-------|------|------|------|
| **fast_checks** | `code_checks` (lint, typecheck, static RBAC scan, all unit suites, UI vitest) **and** `srt_security_review` (SRT security scan) — run in **parallel** | No | ~minutes |
| **deployment_validation** | IAM service-role permission pre-check | Yes (read-only) | seconds |
| **integration_tests** | Full stack deploy + primary suite (Steps 1–12) + deployment-variant probes | Yes (deploys) | ~1 hour |

**Trigger matrix** — what runs, when:

| Event | fast_checks (code + SRT) | deployment_validation | integration_tests |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Push to any branch, **no MR** | ✅ | — | — |
| Push to branch with a **Draft** MR → `develop` | ✅ | ✅ | ▶️ **manual** (button on MR) |
| Push to branch with a **non-Draft** MR → `develop` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ auto |
| Push to **`develop`** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ auto |

Notes:
- **Every push runs fast_checks** (code checks + SRT), so lint/typecheck/unit and
  security feedback is immediate on any branch. GitLab emails the committer on
  failure.
- The **~1h integration deploy runs only** on `develop` and on **non-Draft** MRs
  targeting `develop`. On a **Draft** MR it's a **manual play button** on the MR
  page — run it on demand, not on every WIP push.
- A `workflow:` rule prevents **duplicate** branch+MR pipelines (a branch with an
  open MR runs only the MR pipeline).
- integration_tests uses `resource_group` + `interruptible`, so rapid pushes
  don't stack up concurrent ~1h deploys (a newer run supersedes an older queued
  one).

## Test Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution (Steps 3-11)
- **9 tests run concurrently** to minimize pipeline runtime
- **Fail-fast enabled**: If any test fails, remaining tests are cancelled and cleanup begins
- **Expected runtime**: ~25-35 minutes (vs 60+ minutes sequential)

### Sequential Execution (Step 12)
- **Step 12 (API RBAC) runs alone after the parallel pool drains**
  - **Reason**: Its dynamic harness temporarily flips `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`
    on the shared UI app client (a stack-wide auth mutation) and restores it —
    interleaving with API-hitting parallel tests would corrupt them.

### Concurrent deployment-variant probes (own stacks)
- The **deployment-variant probe framework** (below) deploys SECOND,
  independent stacks — one per probe. Four probes run by default (GLOBAL APIGW,
  WAF, PRIVATE APIGW, headless), **concurrently with the primary suite AND with
  each other** on their own threads, so their ~30-min deploys overlap the
  primary deploy instead of running back-to-back. Each opts out of the primary
  suite's fail-fast abort machinery, so a primary failure never kills a probe's
  in-flight deploy. VPC-requiring probes share one persistent pipeline-owned
  test VPC (so VPCs don't bound concurrency); fan-out is capped by
  `IDP_PROBE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default 8) to bound simultaneous stack/IAM usage.

## Test Coverage

### Step 1: Stack Deployment
**What it tests**: CloudFormation stack deployment
- Template validation
- Nested stack creation (AppSync, Pattern, DocumentKB, MultiDocDiscovery)
- Resource creation and initialization
- Stack outputs verification

**Duration**: ~15-20 minutes

---

### Step 2: Stack Health Check
**What it tests**: Stack readiness
- All nested stacks in `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE` status
- Critical resources accessible
- No rollback or failed states

**Duration**: <1 minute

---

### Step 3: Default Config Test (Pipeline Mode) ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Default pipeline configuration
- Document processing with default config
- Amazon Textract OCR
- Bedrock classification (page-level)
- Bedrock extraction (traditional LLM-based)
- **Verification**:
  - Extraction fields present in output
  - Classification results exist
  - Document status = `COMPLETED`

**Test Document**: `samples/lending_package.pdf`  
**Duration**: ~5-7 minutes

---

### Step 4: BDA Mode Test ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Bedrock Data Automation end-to-end processing

- **Verification**:
  - BDA output structure
  - Document processing completion
  - Results match expected format

**Test Document**: `samples/lending_package.pdf`  
**Duration**: ~6-8 minutes  
**Implementation**: Uses `idp-cli config-sync-bda` to create BDA project/blueprints, then runs inference with `--config-version` parameter (no activation needed)

---

### Step 5: Rule Validation Test ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Business rule validation engine
- Rule execution on extracted data
- Rule statistics (passed/failed/skipped counts)
- **Verification**:
  - Rule validation results present
  - Statistics calculated correctly
  - Rules applied to extracted fields

**Test Document**: `samples/lending_package.pdf`  
**Duration**: ~5-7 minutes

---

### Step 6: Multi-Document Concurrent Batch Processing ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Concurrent document processing at scale
- Multiple documents processed simultaneously
- Concurrency management (DynamoDB counter)
- Batch tracking
- **Verification**:
  - All documents complete successfully
  - No concurrency conflicts
  - Tracking table updated correctly

**Test Documents**: Multiple files from `samples/` directory  
**Duration**: ~6-8 minutes

---

### Step 7: Test Studio Evaluation ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Test Studio evaluation workflow
- Test set processing (limited to 3 documents)
- Evaluation trigger via `idp-cli test-result`
- Metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Cost tracking
- **Verification**:
  - Test run completes successfully
  - Evaluation metrics calculated
  - Overall accuracy > 30% threshold
  - Results retrievable via CLI

**Test Set**: `fake-w2` or `realkie-fcc-verified`  
**Duration**: ~8-10 minutes  
**Implementation**: Uses `idp-cli test-result --wait` command to trigger evaluation

**Architecture**: 
- Calls `getTestRunStatus` Lambda repeatedly (triggers SQS evaluation on first call)
- Polls until status changes from `EVALUATING` to `COMPLETE`
- Retrieves full results with `getTestRun` Lambda
- See [Test Studio Architecture](#test-studio-architecture) below

---

### Step 8: Agentic Extraction with Large Table ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Agentic extraction with deterministic table parsing
- Agent-based extraction (Strands framework)
- Deterministic Markdown table parser
- Large table handling (532 fund items)
- OCR artifact recovery (empty lines, missing pipes)
- **Verification**:
  - All 532 fund items extracted

**Cleanup**: Ingestion jobs cancelled before stack deletion

---

### Step 11: Test Compare ⚡ *Parallel*
**What it tests**: Test comparison CLI command
- Multiple test run execution
- Test result comparison via `idp-cli test-compare`
- Comparison output formatting
- **Verification**:
  - Two test runs complete successfully
  - Comparison output contains expected fields (Test Run ID, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
  - Side-by-side metrics display works

**Test Set**: `fake-w2` or `realkie-fcc-verified`  
**Duration**: ~10-12 minutes (2 test runs + comparison)  
**Execution**: Runs in the parallel pool (only runs inferences, no shared-stack
mutation — safe to interleave).  
**Implementation**: 
- Runs 2 test inferences (2 documents each)
- Waits for both to complete and evaluate
- Calls `idp-cli test-compare` to compare results

---

## Additional Deployment Tests: the deployment-variant probe framework

Separate from the shared-stack suite above (Steps 3–12, which run against ONE
stack deployed with default hosting — CloudFront), a **deployment-variant probe
framework** validates alternative deployment permutations, each on its **own
throwaway IDP stack**. The probes run **concurrently** with the shared-stack
suite *and with each other* (overlapping the ~30-min deploys) and each tears its
stack down afterward.

Each probe is a self-contained *deploy-a-config-variant + smoke-check-its-
distinguishing-feature* unit. The framework is a table of
`Probe(name, stack_suffix, deploy_params, validate_fn, requires_vpc)` rows that
a concurrent launcher iterates — adding a new permutation is **one table row +
a validator**, not a copy-pasted deploy/validate/cleanup function.

> **Scope (important):** probes are **deploy + feature-smoke only, NOT full
> functional coverage.** A variant can deploy clean yet still have a
> doc-processing regression that only the shared-stack suite (Steps 3–12) would
> catch. Don't read a green probe as "this variant processes documents
> correctly" — only as "this variant deploys and its distinguishing feature
> responds."

### The default probes (all four run every pipeline)

| Probe | `stack_suffix` | Distinguishing params | VPC? | Validator asserts |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------|------|-------------------|
| **APIGateway hosting (GLOBAL)** | `apigw` | `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`, `ApiGatewayVisibility=GLOBAL` | no | REST API is **REGIONAL**, `ApplicationWebURL` is the execute-api `/api` URL, **HTTP GET → 200** (internet-reachable, so a real end-to-end UI fetch) |
| **WAF-enabled (IP allow-list)** | `waf` | `WAFAllowedIPv4Ranges` set (+ APIGateway/GLOBAL hosting to have a stage) | no | REGIONAL WebACL `{stack}-api-acl` **exists and is associated** with an API-Gateway stage |
| **APIGateway hosting (PRIVATE)** | `apigwpriv` | `WebUIHosting=APIGateway`, `ApiGatewayVisibility=PRIVATE` | yes | REST API endpoint type is **PRIVATE** and carries a **resource policy** (VPC-only → structural check; CodeBuild can't fetch a private endpoint) |
| **Headless Jobs API** | `headless` | `EnableHeadless=true` | yes | stack exposes the **`ApiGatewayEndpoint`** output and its REST API exists (private → structural check) |

Validators live in `scripts/sdlc/codebuild_deployment.py`:
`validate_apigw_global_hosting`, `validate_waf_enabled`,
`validate_apigw_private_hosting`, `validate_headless_jobs_api`.

**Lifecycle** (every probe): creates per-stack IAM/boundary → (for `requires_vpc`
probes) injects the persistent-test-VPC params → deploys with the probe's extra
CFN params → validates → captures CF failure events before teardown →
**always** tears down the IDP stack (in a `finally`). Each probe runs on its own
thread and opts that thread out of the shared suite's fail-fast abort machinery
(`_thread_local.never_abort`), so a shared-suite failure's kill sweep can never
terminate a probe's in-flight deploy, and one probe failing never affects the
others or the already-completed shared-suite result.

### The persistent test VPC (why VPC probes are now quota-safe)

VPC-requiring probes (PRIVATE hosting, headless) no longer stand up a throwaway
VPC per run. A **single persistent test VPC is owned by the pipeline
CloudFormation stack** (`scripts/sdlc/cfn/codepipeline-s3.yml`, parameter
`CreateTestVpc`, default `true`) and reused by every run. Its ids are handed to
CodeBuild as env vars (`IDP_TEST_VPC_ID`, `IDP_TEST_PRIVATE_SUBNET_IDS`,
`IDP_TEST_LAMBDA_SG_ID`, `IDP_TEST_APIGW_VPCE_ID`); `_test_vpc_params()` maps
them to the CFN params (`DeployInVPC`, `VpcId`, `PrivateSubnetIds` /
`LambdaSubnetIds`, `LambdaSecurityGroupId`, `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId`) that a
`requires_vpc` probe injects at deploy time.

Because probes **reference** the VPC (never create/destroy/mutate it):
- **No VPC quota pressure** — the account's 5-VPC limit is never approached no
  matter how many VPC variants or concurrent pipelines run.
- **No per-run VPC churn or ENI-leak teardown failures** — the incident that
  removed the PRIVATE/VPC variant from CI simply can't recur.
- **Fully parallel** — VPCs no longer bound concurrency, so all four probes run
  at once.

If the pipeline is deployed with `CreateTestVpc=false`, the VPC env vars are
empty and each `requires_vpc` probe **skips itself** (recorded as *skipped*, not
*failed*) — the no-VPC probes (GLOBAL, WAF) still run.

The NAT gateway in the persistent VPC carries a small standing cost
(~US$32/mo + data) — the deliberate trade for quota-safe, fully-parallel VPC
probes. The retired per-run VPC template
(`scripts/sdlc/apigw-hosting-test-vpc.yaml`) and the
`delete_apigw_test_vpc` / `cleanup_stale_apigw_test_vpcs` age-gated reaper are
retained for out-of-band/manual VPC testing.

### Concurrency budget

The launcher fans out to at most `IDP_PROBE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` probes at once
(default `DEFAULT_PROBE_MAX_CONCURRENCY = 8`, clamped to `[1, num_probes]`; a
malformed/≤0 override falls back to the default). Each probe deploys a full IDP
stack (+ IAM role/boundary) concurrently with the shared-stack deploy and any
other in-flight pipeline, so the cap still guards **bounded stack/IAM quota** —
but **VPCs no longer bound it** (one shared persistent VPC). The default is set
high enough to run the whole default table in parallel.

### Gating & implementation

**Gating**: the probes run by default; set `IDP_TEST_APIGW_HOSTING=false` to
skip them all (the env name is kept for backward compatibility).
**Implementation** in `scripts/sdlc/codebuild_deployment.py`: `PROBE_VARIANTS`
(the table), `deploy_and_test_probe()` (one probe's lifecycle, incl. VPC-param
injection + skip), `run_variant_probes()` (the concurrent launcher),
`resolve_probe_concurrency()` (the budget), and `_test_vpc_params()` (env → CFN
params). Launched from `main()` on its own supervisor thread concurrently with
the shared-stack suite. Mock-based unit coverage:
`scripts/sdlc/tests/test_variant_probes.py` (41 tests — quota cap, single-probe
lifecycle, fail-fast isolation, VPC-param injection + skip, all four validators,
consolidated summary).
**Duration**: ~20–30 minutes per probe (full nested-stack create + teardown);
all four run in parallel by default.

### Adding a future variant

Add a `Probe(...)` row to `PROBE_VARIANTS` and supply a
`validate_fn(stack_name) -> {"success": bool, ...}`. Set `requires_vpc=True` to
get the persistent-test-VPC params injected automatically. Keep the
deploy+feature-smoke scope in mind (see above).

**Candidate future variants**: BYO S3 VPC endpoint
(`S3VpcEndpointIdOverride`/`…DnsNameOverride`), custom domain, `--govcloud`
(deploy-only where the account allows — an offline transform + region-aware
`cfn-lint` gate already exists as a fast-gate unit test; see the Gap Backlog).

---

## End-of-run summary (every pipeline, pass or fail)

Every run produces a report in the GitLab job log, uploaded to S3 and emailed via
SNS on failure. It has two layers:

- **A deterministic status table** listing every test — the build/publish step,
  each primary-suite step, and each deployment-variant probe — as passed / failed
  / cancelled / skipped, with an **OVERALL: PASS/FAIL** verdict. It always
  renders, even if the AI layer is unavailable.
- **An AI (Bedrock) narrative** on both pass and fail — a short PASS report, or a
  grounded root-cause analysis for an infrastructure or test failure.

The summary is uploaded **progressively** as steps complete (not just at the
end), so the result is available even when a run is long.

**Watching long runs.** The CodeBuild pipeline runs ~60–70 min and is not
time-capped. The GitLab monitor that watches it has credentials capped at 1 hour
(a hard AWS limit on role-chained sessions), so it **refreshes them mid-run** to
keep watching to ~110 min. If a run outlives that, the monitor hands off
gracefully — the pipeline finishes on its own and the authoritative result still
arrives via the S3 summary + SNS email. A failure detected at handoff fails the
GitLab job (it isn't masked by a green handoff).

---

## Test Studio Architecture

### Lazy Evaluation Design

Test Studio uses **lazy/on-demand evaluation** rather than automatic evaluation. This means metrics are only calculated when explicitly requested.

**Flow**:

1. **Test Run Creation**:
   ```bash
   idp-cli run-inference --test-set fake-w2
   ```
   - Creates DynamoDB record: `PK=testrun#{test_run_id}`, `SK=metadata`
   - Status: `QUEUED` → `RUNNING`

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Files processed through IDP pipeline
   - Each document: `ObjectStatus=COMPLETED`, `EvaluationStatus=COMPLETED`
   - Test run metadata: `Status=COMPLETE`, `CompletedFiles=N`
   - **Note**: `testRunResult` field does NOT exist yet

3. **Evaluation Trigger** (via CLI):
   ```bash
   idp-cli test-result --test-run-id <id> --wait
   ```
   - Invokes `TestResultsResolverFunction` Lambda with `getTestRunStatus`
   - Lambda detects `Status=COMPLETE` but no `testRunResult`
   - Sends SQS message to trigger evaluation
   - Returns `display_status=EVALUATING`

4. **Async Evaluation** (SQS worker):
   - SQS triggers same Lambda with `handle_cache_update_request()`
   - Calls `_aggregate_test_run_metrics()`:
     - Queries Athena for evaluation data
     - Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1, cost
   - Writes `testRunResult` to DynamoDB

5. **Polling for Completion**:
   - CLI polls `getTestRunStatus` every 10 seconds
   - When `testRunResult` exists, status changes to `COMPLETE`
   - CLI calls `getTestRun` to retrieve full results

**Why This Design**:
- Avoids expensive Athena queries on every batch completion
- Allows UI to show "EVALUATING" status while metrics calculate
- Evaluation only runs when results are actually needed

**CI/CD Implementation**:
```python
# Old approach (BROKEN): Direct DynamoDB polling
# This never triggered evaluation!
dynamodb.query(TableName=tracking_table, Key=...)

# New approach (WORKING): Use idp-cli test-result
run_command("idp-cli test-result --stack-name {stack} --test-run-id {id} --wait")
```

## Test Cleanup

### Bedrock Ingestion Job Cleanup
**Problem**: Discovery tests (Steps 9, 10) start Bedrock Knowledge Base ingestion jobs that take 30+ minutes. If fail-fast triggers early, cleanup runs while jobs are `IN_PROGRESS`, blocking stack deletion.

**Solution**: `cancel_bedrock_ingestion_jobs()` function:
1. Scans all stack resources for `AWS::Bedrock::DataSource`
2. Lists ingestion jobs for each data source
3. Stops any `IN_PROGRESS` jobs
4. Then proceeds with stack deletion

**IAM Permissions**: `bedrock:ListIngestionJobs`, `bedrock:StopIngestionJob`

### Stack Deletion
- Cancels all Bedrock ingestion jobs
- Deletes nested stacks first (AppSync, Pattern, DocumentKB, MultiDocDiscovery)
- Deletes main stack
- Cleans up S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions

### Startup reapers (converge leaks from interrupted prior runs)

Each run tears down its own stacks and buckets, but an interrupted teardown (e.g.
credentials expiring mid-cleanup) can leak them — and leaked test resources had
previously exhausted the account's IAM-role quota and piled up thousands of
buckets. To stay self-healing, every run first reaps **stale** leftovers from
prior runs: test VPCs, IDP stacks (and their IAM helper stacks), and orphaned S3
buckets. All reapers are **age-gated and skip anything a concurrent pipeline is
still using**, so they never touch a live run.

## Success Criteria

### Test Pass Criteria
- All tests return `{"success": True}`
- No exceptions or errors
- Verification checks pass
- Expected outputs present

### Accuracy Thresholds
- **Test Studio (Step 7)**: Overall accuracy > 30%
- **Agentic Extraction (Step 8)**: All 532 fund items extracted (100% completeness)

### Performance Thresholds
- **Total pipeline runtime**: < 60 minutes (with parallel execution)
- **Stack deployment**: < 25 minutes
- **Test execution**: < 35 minutes
- **Cleanup**: < 5 minutes

## Verification Methods

### Output Verification
- **Extraction**: Checks for specific extracted fields (e.g., `applicant_name`, `loan_amount`)
- **Classification**: Verifies classification results exist
- **Rule Validation**: Validates rule statistics (passed, failed, skipped counts)
- **Agentic Extraction**: Counts extracted items (e.g., 532 fund items)

### Status Verification
- **Document Status**: Confirms `ObjectStatus=COMPLETED`
- **Batch Status**: Verifies all documents in batch complete
- **Test Run Status**: Checks test evaluation status via Lambda invocation
- **Stack Status**: Ensures `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE`

### CLI Command Verification
- **Test Studio**: Uses `idp-cli test-result` to trigger evaluation and retrieve metrics
- **Discovery**: Monitors workflow execution via tracking table
- **Config Management**: Validates config upload, activation, and retrieval

### New CLI Commands (v0.5.6)

#### `idp-cli test-result`
Get test results for a specific test run. Triggers evaluation if needed.

```bash
# Get results immediately (may show evaluating status)
idp-cli test-result --stack-name my-stack --test-run-id fake-w2-20260409-123456

# Wait for evaluation to complete (recommended for CI/CD)
idp-cli test-result --stack-name my-stack --test-run-id fake-w2-20260409-123456 --wait --timeout 900

# Save results to JSON file
idp-cli test-result --stack-name my-stack --test-run-id fake-w2-20260409-123456 --wait --output-dir ./results
```

**Output**:
- Overall Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

```

**Output**:
- Side-by-side metrics comparison table
- Configuration differences between runs
- Cost comparison

**Output Files** (when `--output-dir` specified):
- `comparison-<timestamp>.json` - Full comparison data
- `comparison-<timestamp>.csv` - Metrics table (for spreadsheets)

## Monitoring and Debugging

### CloudWatch Logs
- **CodeBuild Logs**: `/aws/codebuild/<project-name>`
- **Lambda Logs**: `/aws/lambda/<function-name>`
- **Step Functions**: View execution history in console
- **Test Results Resolver**: `/aws/lambda/TestResultsResolverFunction`

### Tracking Table
- **Location**: DynamoDB table from stack output `DynamoDBTrackingTableConsoleURL`
- **Records**:
  - Documents: `PK=doc#{document_id}`, `SK=none`
  - Test Runs: `PK=testrun#{test_run_id}`, `SK=metadata`
  - Batches: `PK=batch#{batch_id}`, `SK=metadata`

### Common Failure Points
1. **Step 7 (Test Studio)**: Evaluation timeout - ensure `idp-cli test-result --wait` is used
2. **Step 8 (Agentic)**: Table parsing failures if OCR quality poor
3. **Steps 9-10 (Discovery)**: Ingestion job cleanup failures if permissions missing
4. **Step 4 (BDA)**: BDA sync failures or blueprint creation errors
5. **Step 11 (test-compare)**: Requires TestResultsResolverFunctionArn in stack outputs
6. **Parallel Tests**: Fail-fast cancellation if any test fails

### Debugging Test Studio Issues

If Test Studio test fails:

1. **Check test run exists**:
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb query --table-name <tracking-table> \
     --key-condition-expression "PK = :pk AND SK = :sk" \
     --expression-attribute-values '{":pk":{"S":"testrun#<test-run-id>"},":sk":{"S":"metadata"}}'
   ```

2. **Manually trigger evaluation**:
   ```bash
   idp-cli test-result --stack-name <stack> --test-run-id <id> --wait --timeout 900
   ```

3. **Check Lambda logs**:
   - CloudWatch Logs: `/aws/lambda/<stack>-TestResultsResolverFunction-*`
   - Look for SQS message sending and metric aggregation

4. **Check SQS queue**:
   ```bash
   aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url <TEST_RESULT_CACHE_UPDATE_QUEUE_URL> \
     --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages
   ```

## TODO / Gap Backlog

Remaining CI test-coverage gaps, ranked. Nothing here is blocking; these are
follow-ups to harden the pipeline against regressions on `develop`. Several
earlier gaps are **already closed** — see "Done (this cycle)" at the end.

The full unit/package gate (`make test`, 34 auto-discovered roots) is green.
What's left below is mostly integration/e2e depth plus a few cheap fast-gate
additions.

### Fast-gate additions (cheap, no live AWS account needed)

- [x] **`--govcloud` transform + cfn-lint gate (unit-level).** `GovCloudTemplate
      Transformer` runs against the committed `template.yaml` and the result is
      linted with real `cfn-lint --region us-gov-west-1`, asserting zero **E3006**
      ("resource type does not exist in region"). Fails the gate if a
      GovCloud-unsupported resource (CloudFront, Lambda Function URL, etc.) is
      reintroduced — strictly stronger than the transformer's own hardcoded
      resource check. Offline/no-credentials. See
      `lib/idp_sdk/tests/unit/test_govcloud_template_transform.py::test_real_
      template_passes_govcloud_region_cfn_lint`. *(Note: the raw repo template
      carries SAM short-form tags, so a full lint of the **published/SAM-baked**
      template still needs the publish pipeline — deferred to the integration
      tier.)*
- [ ] **`--headless` template-transform smoke.** At minimum, run the
      `HeadlessTemplateTransformer` + cfn-lint in the fast gate to catch transform
      breakage without a deploy. (Full headless *deploy* e2e is below.) *(A
      real-template `HeadlessTemplateTransformer` dangling-ref test already
      exists in `test_template_transform.py`; the remaining gap is a
      region-aware `cfn-lint` pass over the transformed headless template like
      the govcloud one above.)*
- [x] **Register the `pytest.mark.unit` marker repo-wide.** A minimal repo-root
      `pytest.ini` registers the `unit` / `integration` markers, so the ~12
      per-Lambda/resolver dirs without their own config no longer emit
      `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`. Suites with their own `pytest.ini` are
      unaffected (closer config wins).

### Integration / e2e depth (need the CI account; run in the CodeBuild suite)

- [x] **`--headless` deploy e2e (deploy + feature-smoke).** Now a
      deployment-variant probe (`headless`): deploys `EnableHeadless=true` against
      the persistent test VPC and asserts the Jobs API deployed
      (`validate_headless_jobs_api`). *Deploy + smoke only* — the private Jobs API
      isn't call-tested from CodeBuild (not in-VPC), and full doc-processing
      through the headless path is still not exercised, so the deeper
      `scripts/e2e_test_headless.py` flow remains a follow-up.
- [x] **APIGW hosting: GLOBAL variant + HTTP smoke.** The GLOBAL/no-VPC APIGW
      hosting probe deploys `WebUIHosting=APIGateway` + `ApiGatewayVisibility=GLOBAL`
      and does a real HTTP `GET` of the served UI (`validate_apigw_global_hosting`
      asserts HTTP 200 from the execute-api `/api` URL, proving the S3-proxy path
      returns bytes). Now the first row of the deployment-variant probe framework.
- [ ] **Upgrade-in-place test. (HIGH VALUE.)** Deploy the previous released
      version, then update the stack to the current build, then smoke. This is the
      gap that would have caught the pricing-units rollback deadlock and the
      GSI-projection-immutable issues. No current test exercises an update path.
- [ ] **Deepen e2e assertions.** Most steps assert `status==COMPLETE` /
      sections-exist. Broaden to assert expected field *values* from the known
      sample docs (e.g. `samples/lending_package.pdf`) — near-zero added runtime,
      catches silent accuracy regressions.
- [ ] **`save_reporting_data` reporting-path e2e.** Unit tests were mocked off real
      AWS; there is no e2e that actually exercises the Glue/Athena reporting write
      path end-to-end.
- [ ] **CloudFront (default) hosting HTTP smoke.** The shared-stack suite deploys
      with CloudFront hosting but never HTTP-smokes the CloudFront URL.

### UI

- [ ] **Browser/e2e UI test (Playwright) against a deployed stack.** Today only
      vitest units run (jsdom, no browser). A thin smoke (login → list docs → open
      a doc) would catch integration/auth regressions the units can't.

### Quarantined test roots — promote when unblocked

Tracked in `scripts/run_all_tests.py` (`QUARANTINE`). Correctly excluded today,
but revisit:

- [ ] `src/lambda/ocr_benchmark_deployer` — needs `huggingface_hub` as a test dep.
- [ ] `nested/bedrockkb/src/s3_vectors_manager` — needs the Lambda-runtime-only
      `cfnresponse` module available under test.
- [ ] `scripts/test_api_rbac.py` — the live RBAC harness (not a pytest suite);
      leave excluded unless refactored.
- [ ] `samples/lambda-hook-inference/GENAIIDP-chandra-ocr-hook` — `test_local.py`
      is a manual run script; leave excluded or convert to real tests.
- [ ] `lib/idp_sdk/idp_sdk/_core` — source tree with helper modules named
      `test_*`; leave excluded (not tests).

### Done (this cycle — no longer gaps)

- [x] `idp_common` `-m "unit"` filter → `-m "not integration"` (recovered ~810
      silently-skipped tests; fixed 28 rotted tests). *(PR #493)*
- [x] Missing package/Lambda suites added to `developer_tests` via
      `make test-packages-cicd` (~665 tests). *(PR #494)*
- [x] `check-arn-partitions` (GovCloud ARN guard) wired into `lint-cicd`. *(PR #494)*
- [x] API RBAC: static scan in the MR gate + live harness as CodeBuild Step 12.
      *(PR #494)*
- [x] SRT security scan runs fail-fast (before the ~2h integration stage) on
      branch pipelines. *(PR #494)*
- [x] Deployment-failure AI root-cause summary (incl. Step 4b) + failure email
      (`FailureNotificationEmail` SNS). *(PR #494)*
- [x] `make test` auto-discovers all test roots; a new/unregistered test dir
      hard-fails so suites can't be silently skipped. *(PR #495)*
- [x] Fixed the Step Functions execution-view "Running vs Failed" resolver bug and
      `save_reporting_data` stale/real-AWS tests; both promoted into the gate.
      *(PR #495)*
- [x] CodeBuild role granted EC2/VPC permissions for the Step 4b hosting test.
      *(PR #497)*
- [x] Stopped `idp_sdk` `test_create_config` writing a stray `config.yaml` to the
      repo root. *(PR #498)*
- [x] Generalized the single APIGW hosting test into the **deployment-variant
      probe framework** (`PROBE_VARIANTS` table + `run_variant_probes` launcher +
      `resolve_probe_concurrency` quota budget), with mock-based unit tests in
      `scripts/sdlc/tests/`. *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] Repo-root `pytest.ini` registering the shared `unit`/`integration` markers
      (silences `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` in ~12 per-Lambda dirs).
      *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] Real `cfn-lint --region us-gov-west-1` E3006 gate on the transformed
      committed template (offline fast-gate unit test).
      *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] **Persistent pipeline-owned test VPC** (`codepipeline-s3.yml`,
      `CreateTestVpc`) reused by every run → VPC-requiring probes are quota-safe
      and fully parallel; no per-run VPC create/destroy or ENI leaks.
      *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] **Three new probes** — WAF-enabled (IP allow-list), PRIVATE APIGW hosting,
      and headless Jobs API — added to `PROBE_VARIANTS` (all default-on), plus
      `DEFAULT_PROBE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` raised so the whole table runs in parallel.
      *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] **Every-run consolidated summary** (`build_consolidated_summary`) listing
      publish + every primary step + every probe with status + OVERALL PASS/FAIL,
      always rendered to the GitLab log and uploaded to S3/SNS; Bedrock now writes
      a grounded report on **pass as well as fail**.
      *(fix/ci-variant-probe-framework)*
- [x] **Startup reapers for leaked test stacks, IAM roles, and buckets** —
      age-gated and concurrent-run-safe, so an interrupted cleanup can't exhaust
      the account's IAM-role quota or pile up buckets again.
- [x] **Handoff FAIL verdict** — the monitor fails the GitLab job when the
      summary shows OVERALL: FAIL, instead of exiting green.
- [x] **Progressive summary upload** — a current result reaches S3 before the
      monitor handoff even when a run is long (fixed a finished run showing "No
      summary found").
- [x] **Mid-run monitor credential refresh** — the monitor refreshes its
      1h-capped credentials to watch long runs to ~110 min. *(Needs a live >1h
      run to fully validate.)*
